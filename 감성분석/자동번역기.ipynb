However, it is known that the collection of subscription margin was not very smooth.Currently, NEPROIT has recovered a total of KRW 100 million, including about KRW 10 million in subscription evidence that has not been withdrawn and KRW 10 million in refund measures. The amount that has not been recovered so far is a total of 100 million won.NEPROIT said it believes that about 100 million won out of the 100 million won will be recoverable because withdrawal transactions have been suspended. The problem is the remaining 100 million won. Currently, a warrant has been issued and tracking is underway, but the exact amount that can be recovered cannot be confirmed yet, according to the company.The industry is concerned that Nepro Haiti\\'s embezzlement could hurt investors\\' trust in the micro-public offering system. This is because the subscription funds raised by Nepro Haiti through a paid-in capital increase in small public offerings have disappeared and the recovery of the funds is uncertain.Small-scale public offering is a system introduced to solve the financial difficulties of companies that are difficult to raise funds in a normal way, and is usually carried out on a small scale of less than 100 million won. Since the size of the public offering is small, there is no need to obtain permission from financial authorities like a general paid-in capital increase.An official from a KOSDAQ company said, \"This incident has set a precedent for exploitation of the small public offering system, which helped raise funds urgently,\" adding, \"We are worried that it will be difficult to raise funds through related systems.\"It is also a matter of interest whether Nepro Haiti will be delisted or not listed.

This is the first time that a foreign company listed in Korea has been subject to a delisting review.According to the industry, the KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange has launched an investigation into whether Nepro Haiti is subject to delisting.The cause is a large-scale embezzlement charge that occurred in the process of Nepro Haiti handing over its management rights to Mandarin West. Park Tae-kyung, known as a representative of Mandarin West, who decided to acquire Nepro Haiti, has embezzled KRW 100 million in subscription evidence for a paid-in capital increase in general public offerings and disappeared. This is the first time that an agent of a company that has decided to take over management rights has embezzled subscription evidence, not even public offering funds.NeproIty signed a management transfer contract with Mandarin West on the last day and decided to increase its paid-in capital for general public offerings worth billions of won. In addition, a subscription was made for a paid-in capital increase for general public offerings. However, in the process, Park embezzled about 100 million won in subscription evidence, making NeproIti the first foreign company listed in Korea to be judged on the substance of delisting.An official of the Korea Exchange said, \"Nepro-Iti asked the Gangnam Police Station to investigate Park\\'s embezzlement, and investigated the issue of delisting. This will be the first time that he embezzled the capital after issuing new shares.\"An official from Nepro Haiti said, \"Park, who served as Mandarin West\\'s agent during the transfer of management rights, embezzled the subscription margin and asked the Gangnam Police Station to investigate the case,\" adding, \"We are currently looking for Park, whose whereabouts are unknown.\" He added, however, that after learning about Park\\'s embezzlement, the account containing the subscription margin has been frozen.NEPROIT, whose main business is services such as mobile content sales, was listed on the domestic stock market for the first time as a Japanese company in last month. At that time, Samsung Securities entered the stock market splendidly as the organizer, but has been sluggish in terms of performance since then.Investors were confused when Japanese companies, which are listed in Korea, were at a crossroads between withdrawal and maintenance of the listing for the first time in years. There are a series of postings criticizing the company on the bulletin board in the securities portal.In particular, the distrust of foreign companies seems to be spreading from China to Japan as Nepro Haiti is showing signs of instability, such as being on the verge of being kicked out. As a result, the Korea Exchange is preparing a plan to manage foreign companies, but it is expected that it will be difficult to avoid criticism that it will fix the barn after losing the cow because the ancient island crisis in China has already occurred.A high-ranking official in the corporate disclosure division of a securities firm pointed out that Nepro Haiti\\'s amortization crisis and China\\'s ancient island crisis were the result of excessive moves to list foreign companies.Reporter Ahn Hyun-duk...The world of popular articles on I-DOTCOM Korea has published a surprising book by a Korean professor.

The limit of small-scale public offering increased to 100 million won last year and then decreased to 100 million won from last year.Financial authorities have initially considered supplementary measures such as the abolition of the small public offering system and strengthening the management of subscription margins.The securities industry is also negative about the abolition of the small public offering system.An official from the securities industry said, \"Companies that use the small-scale public offering system should be considered to have difficulty raising funds,\" adding, \"There are some undesirable cases, but if the system itself is removed, it will be more shocking for companies.\" The official added that it should be improved to supplement the requirements and procedures disclosure system.Meanwhile, a series of small paid-in capital increases have been made by KOSDAQ-listed companies even after the embezzlement of Nepro Haiti public offering funds.According to the Financial Supervisory Service\\'s electronic disclosure system, since last month, when the embezzlement of NEPROIT public offering funds was announced, Hallim Changtu Polyplus Turbo Tech and others will conduct a small paid-in capital increase of less than 100 million won.All three are conducted in a public offering method by general investors, and all of them are for raising operating funds, except that Polyplus allocated 10,000 won with other funds. The amount of public offering funds is also the same as Hallym Changtu\\'s Polyplus\\'s KRW 10 million and Turbo Tech\\'s KRW 10 million.The problem is that there is a risk of an accident at any time because there is no obligation to submit a securities report if a public offering is held for less than 100 million won. It was a small public offering system designed to facilitate financing by small and medium-sized companies, but there have been many cases of abuse by marginal companies.

Of the 100 million won, the money remained in the NEPROIT account, and NEPROIT returned the money to investors who participated in the subscription.According to the company, the source of the billion won has been identified, and the remaining 100 million won is believed to be in the account under the name of the criminal Park Tae-An official at the Gangnam Police Station said, \"We will obtain a warrant and check the bank account of Park Tae-kyung to trace the source of the remaining funds.\" The Gangnam Police Station is currently pursuing Park Tae-kyung to secure her personal safety, but has yet to catch her.Unlike the initial public announcement, the funds Park Tae-kyung siphoned off were about 100 million won. In the process of disclosing, it was announced that the entire amount of evidence was stolen because the exact details were not delivered to the law firm acting on behalf of the disclosure because all Nepro IT employees who spoke Korean went to police stations and banks.An official from Nepro Haiti said, \"We have secured about 100 million won and found about 100 million won in total,\" adding, \"We will track down Park Tae-kyung\\'s account and recover as much money as possible, and if there is anything we can\\'t find, we will fulfill our responsibilities.\"Park Tae-kyung is said to be a merger and acquisition agent dispatched from Mandarin West, the buyer, to help Neproiti sell its management rights.Park Tae-kyung took advantage of the fact that NEPROIT executives were not familiar with Korean affairs, tricked them into obtaining a seal, made a bankbook under the company\\'s name, received capital increase subscription funds, and diverted the money to his or her account last weekend. At the time of handing over the seal, the company asked him to open a separate deposit account, but Park Tae-kyung arbitrarily made a general deposit account and committed the crime.An official from Nepro IT said, \"All employees of the company are working day and night to get their money back,\" adding, \"It\\'s unfair because it\\'s seen as an eating and running company.\"',\n",

Although the transfer of management rights has not been completed, Mandarin West decided to raise KRW 100 million in paid-in capital increase through a small public offering method and made a subscription for the past day.Small public offerings of less than 100 million won can be carried out directly by listed companies without organizers, and there is no need to escrow subscription margins to banks, so they are usually not very popular by companies that have reached their limits.However, a large amount of money of KRW 100 million flowed into the contest. It has gained popularity because new investors have decided to take over management rights and the issuance price of new shares is about lower than the current stock price. One hundred million won is twice the amount of capital.In the first place, about 100 million won, which exceeded the initial public offering amount, should be returned to investors later, but Park went into hiding after diverting the deposit into another account.As a result, it has become unclear whether Nepro Haiti will maintain its listing.After the disclosure of embezzlement, the Korea Exchange decided to suspend the transaction of NEPROIT and examine whether it should be delisted or not...Prohibition of unauthorized reproduction and redistribution of copyrighted no-cut news',\n",
       " \"Mistrust of foreign companies listed in Korea is soaring. China's Goseom is suspended from trading on charges of fraudulent accounting for its subsidiaries. Amid the ongoing shock of the island, an unprecedented theft of subscription evidence occurred in Nepro Haiti, the only Japanese listed in Korea.If you look at it, the market often commits the error of generalization through this. A case in point is the theme stock. Stock prices rise and fall if companies ignore different situations such as fundamentals and major shareholder risks and are unconditionally linked to themes.The same is true of foreign companies. The whole thing was tied to the theme, paying attention to some situations. When it comes to foreign companies, they shake their heads first. However, not all Chinese companies are the same. Some companies have recently withdrawn their listings due to China risks. Among them, a company called Combine Will Holdings is actually ambiguous to see as a Chinese company. Hong Kong Capital Management grew up and studied in the United States.Combinewill's management set the disclosure time on a Korean time basis, and the articles of association were tricky to follow stronger laws between Singapore and Korean law, citing transparency as the greatest management principle. But it was all useless. Demand forecasts for institutional investors showed prices below expectations and forced to give up listing on the Korean market.Global SM and Cowell, listed on the KOSDAQ, are involved in Chinese companies in the case of Holdings, but their largest shareholders are Koreans. This is a case of registration as a Chinese subsidiary because it operates a factory in China following a large company that entered China.In a way, the growing distrust of foreign companies due to the Nepro Haiti incident can be seen as an error in generalization. NeproIti was robbed of its subscription margin for a paid-in capital increase in the process of selling management rights to Hong Kong-based Mandarin West, and it was a Korean who ran away with it. Of course, there will be the fault of the company that did not manage properly, but on the other hand, I understand Nepro Haiti's position, which calls us the biggest victims.A total of foreign companies are listed on the exchange and KOSDAQ. There are Chinese companies, and there are Japanese and U.S. Laotian companies, respectively. Among them, some companies doubled their net profit last year compared to the previous year. Some companies have recorded the highest quarterly performance. These days, the investment maxim that there is a masterpiece among the rumors is emerging.

       " 'Will it expand to the risk of foreign listed companies?The embezzlement of the paid-in capital increase of Nepro Haiti, a Japanese listed company, is shocking the stock market. As Japanese companies have caused accidents following Chinese-listed companies such as China\\'s Go Island, distrust of all foreign-listed companies is growing.According to the Japanese securities industry, the amount estimated to have been embezzled is about 100 million won, not 100 million won originally known. This is because the company froze the bank account after confirming that some of the paid-in capital increase subscription evidence was withdrawn.Earlier in the past day, NEPROIT carried out a paid-in capital increase worth billions of won. It attracted hundreds of millions of won in deposits by enticing investors to issue new shares at a price that is about cheaper than the current stock price. However, Park Tae-kyung, vice president of Mandarin West, a Hong Kong-based foreign company that decided to take over the management rights of Nephrology on Monday, went into hiding after embezzling the money.The Korea Exchange is suspending NEPROIT\\'s transactions and examining whether they are subject to a substantive review of delisting. If it is decided to be a funeral service, it will even be stamped with a scarlet letter saying that it is the first foreign company to be expelled from the Korean stock market.In particular, the incident is expected to be a starting point for improving the small-scale public offering system. The small-scale public offering system allows listed companies to proceed directly without going through the organizer if they raise less than 100 million won, and avoids difficult procedures such as releasing the obligation to escrow subscription evidence into their accounts. Vice President Park caused the incident by exploiting the system.An official from the financial authorities said, \"We are considering changing related laws such as keeping the subscription margin safe until it is refunded or abolishing the small public offering itself only for listed companies.\"Other foreign listed companies are also apparently embarrassed by the incident. This is because, as seen by China Discount, some companies may cause the entire company to be sold. An official of a foreign listed company said, \"I had a heartache because of China\\'s ancient island, but I\\'m embarrassed that this happened again,\" adding, \"However, this issue is a problem for KOSDAQ listed companies, but it should not be seen as a foreign business.\"Reporter Kim Han-joon: Today\\'s hot news conference, Mobile Korea Forum, has been flooded with reservations, and my car has been mobilized to the military.Imported car driver Hwangdang Children\\'s Day, Memorial Day, National Foundation Day, and New Year holidays.

The expected amount of damage to the company amounts to equity capital.It was previously confirmed that Cheil Chang-tu falsely wrote financial statements that overstated sales of KRW 100 million and KRW 100 million, respectively, last year and last year, and indicted by the Seoul Central District Court. The Korea Exchange plans to examine whether Cheil Industries is subject to a substantial review of delisting.Energy solution Codex Combine has also been rumored to be embezzled.

The company said director Song took responsibility and paid the company the amount of compensation, and plans to compensate the embezzlement with his own private property.Codez Combine is also suffering from rumors of embezzlement and breach of trust. The company said it is conducting an investigation by seizing and searching the company at the Southern District Prosecutors\\' Office in Seoul on the last month, but there is no confirmation on the facts and details of the embezzlement breach of trust.Codez Combine once suffered a management dispute between CEO Park Sung-don and his ex-wife, Oh Mae-hwa.

In the middle of last month, Histem was reviewed by the Korea Exchange whether it was subject to a substantial examination for delisting after Kim Eung-ki, the real owner of Dowry World, was accused of embezzling KRW 100 million.Histem, who was embezzled from the company\\'s capital, explained that the embezzlement occurred last month when Kim and others provided 100 million won in transferable deposit certificates owned by the company to private lenders in Myeong-dong. Last month, the Korea Exchange decided to delist the company after a comprehensive evaluation of its history system.In the case of Nextech, it was subject to a substantial review of delisting due to a change in management rights in the state of investor ventilation stocks on the last day. In the case of insolvent companies, frequent changes in largest shareholders and management tend to occur, so in the case of ventilation stocks, changes in management rights may be the reason for the de-listing.According to the exchange, the largest shareholder has been changed. times in recent years, and the replacement of the CEO has reached an average of . times in the case of the company that was withdrawn from the KOSDAQ market last year. During the same period, some of the companies that were subject to the substantive review of delisting experienced changes in their largest shareholders.Mandarin West\\'s negotiating agent, who signed a contract to transfer management rights to Nepro Haiti, a Japanese listed company in Korea, is considering whether Park Tae-kyung will be subject to a substantial review of the delisting as he embezzled the amount of subscription evidence for a general public offering.According to NeproTI, the refund of KRW 100 million, including KRW 10 million not withdrawn and KRW 10 million returned, has been completed. The remaining billion won is expected to be recovered due to the suspension of withdrawal transactions, and about 100 million won is being tracked after a warrant has been issued.\"Most of the stocks subject to KOSDAQ delisting are due to embezzlement and breach of trust,\" an exchange official said, adding that the number of companies is increasing as new executives voluntarily report or investigate cases that occurred a year ago.The company that was kicked out of the KOSDAQ stock market this year is Nature Global SVH Handysoft Kyung Yoon Hydro EduPass Hepahov.

While the KOSPI rose last year, the KOSDAQ index hardly rose, especially the current KOSDAQ index is only at its annual high.Another reason why investors are paying attention to KOSDAQ is that the burden on foreign uncertainties such as the debt crisis in the U.S. and Europe is less than that of large-cap stocks.In particular, the strength of the KOSDAQ market is more eye-catching in that it is led by institutions, not big-handed individuals. Institutional investors continued their net buying streak for consecutive trading days from the past to the next day, buying more than 100 million won during the period.However, despite the festive atmosphere of the KOSDAQ market, incidents by KOSDAQ companies have continued.

Park Tae-kyung, vice president of Mandarin West, a Hong Kong-based company that decided to take over the management rights of Nepro Haiti, embezzled 100 million won in subscription evidence for a paid-in capital increase.After seeing the Nepro Haiti incident, some say that KOSDAQ is right. Many point out that the KOSDAQ index remained in place while the KOSPI soared last year because KOSDAQ companies were on the investigation list on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust, greatly undermining trust in KOSDAQ.In fact, most of the KOSDAQ companies that were delisted after undergoing a substantial review last year were finally removed due to unhealthy activities such as violations of embezzlement and malpractice accounting standards.Unless concerns about the morality of KOSDAQ companies are resolved, the hot KOSDAQ market will also end in a summer night's dream.

The focus is on creating safeguards to prevent a recurrence of recent incidents such as the embezzlement of subscription evidence by Nepro Haiti, but it is reported that it has not ruled out abolishing them at all.A senior official of the Japanese financial authorities said, \"The system was considered to be abolished due to continuous criticism that there were many problems,\" adding, \"Although it was maintained to help small and medium-sized companies raise funds, we decided to improve the system.\"The official stressed that the small public offering system has been reduced to a means of survival for marginal companies whose financial conditions have worsened rather than a positive function of helping small and medium-sized companies raise funds.Financial authorities are currently considering preventing companies from arbitrarily withdrawing them through the introduction of escrow systems, judging that there may be problems such as embezzlement in the process of receiving subscription evidence and depositing them.An official from the financial authorities said, \"Even if the escrow system is introduced, there are cases where law firms withdraw funds without permission, so we are considering various measures.\"It is also pointed out that the current small public offering system can be implemented at any time as long as it is announced. As there are cases of receiving documents on the day of the contest, it has also been decided to come up with improvement measures.Meanwhile, in the recent KOSDAQ-listed Japanese company Nepro Haiti, Park Tae-kyung, vice president of Mandarin West, a management transferee, ran away with about KRW 100 million in paid-in capital increase subscription evidence without permission.

The person in charge and contact information related to the disclosure is a lawyer for Sejong, a law firm. This is because Nepro Haiti has designated Sejong, a law firm, as a public agent.Foreign companies listed on the domestic stock market are currently the total opening companies, among them, Sung Yong-kwang Investment Co. and China Haoran Co. have law firms as public managers. A company that had a public consultant as a consulting firm designated a private accounting firm as a private accounting firm, while the rest reported a Korean office as an agent.The Korea Exchange requires foreign companies listed in Korea to designate and report the disclosure manager, the disclosure manager, and the disclosure manager. Public prosecutors do not have qualification conditions, but they can contact whether there is a domestic office.An official at a securities firm said, \"We recommend that the exchange designate a place with public confidence as a public broker,\" adding, \"Foreign companies prefer law firms because they have to interpret the wording of the disclosure regulations.\"This is because legal advice is essential to prevent problems arising from inexperience in Korean legal regulations. A foreign company currently preparing to be listed here also plans to designate a law firm in charge of consulting domestic law as a public broker.Korean companies listed on overseas stock markets are similar.

       " 'Recently, distrust of Chinese companies has grown due to various controversies such as suspension of transactions on Chinese islands, but this phenomenon is not limited to Chinese companies. U.S. and Japanese companies listed in Korea are also showing sluggish stock prices, raising concerns that foreign companies listed on the local stock market may be reduced to market degradation.NEPROIT, a Japanese company listed on the KOSDAQ, closed with one member. It has already fallen against the initial public offering price. New Pride, an American company, is no different. New Pride shares fell against the initial public offering price.Looking at the performance, the level of stock prices is acceptable. NEPROIT recorded a net loss of KRW 100 million in operating losses last year, widening its deficit compared to the same period last year. Sales have fallen to hundreds of millions of won. In addition, NEPROIT recorded a loss of continuous business before deducting corporate tax costs.New Pride\\'s performance is also bad. New Pride posted a year-on-year operating profit last year. It was only a sharp drop in millions of won. Net loss for the current term was converted into a deficit of 100 million won. Given the performance of U.S. and Japanese companies, only Chinese companies with good performance cannot be treated as troublesome.In the same situation, another U.S. company knocked on the door of the KOSDAQ market. On the last day, United Merchant, a U.S. company, filed a preliminary listing review request with the KOSDAQ market headquarters of the Korea Exchange. If United Merchant succeeds in listing, it will become a KOSDAQ-listed U.S. company following New Pride. United Merchant posted a net profit of US$10,000 last year, with its equity capital of $10,000 and its largest shareholder is Korean-American.As domestic listed foreign companies continue to be sluggish, their views on the listing organizers are not good. NeproI was in charge of Samsung Securities, and New Pride was in charge of Golden Bridge Investment & Securities.Experts stress that foreign companies need to increase their chances of contact with Korean investors to resolve their distrust. An official from the securities industry pointed out, \"We should frequently create opportunities to instill confidence in Korean investors by holding frequent corporate briefing sessions after listing.\" I can meet Asian economy at half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price, half price.

A Financial Supervisory Service official said, \"We have felt the need to improve the small public offering system, but we are currently discussing various proposals with the Financial Services Commission, saying, \"We have a greater consensus on the improvement due to the embezzlement incident.\"The financial supervisory authority\\'s plan to improve the micro-public offering system is first abolished.Since companies with public confidence in listed companies do not have to raise funds through small public offerings, a proposal to ban small public offerings is being discussed on this occasion. In addition, measures to apply escrow-like devices to small public offerings, such as allowing financial institutions to manage subscription margins, are also being considered as improvement measures.In addition, the government is considering providing a basis for clarifying liability for damages that may occur during the small-scale public offering process, and strictly complying with the upper limit of the small-scale public offering of KRW 100 million is also being discussed as an improvement measure.Later in the day, NeproIty announced in a public announcement that it would withdraw its decision to raise the capital.NeproIty explained that it has decided to withdraw the refund of subscription surcharges due to the embezzlement case, and as a result, it is difficult to proceed with the issuance of new shares due to the paid-in capital increase.An official from the Korea Exchange said, \"We understand that Nepro Haiti is currently in talks with investors who have subscribed to the paid-in capital increase in the deposit refund sector.\"Meanwhile, the incident is feared to spread distrust to other listed foreign companies in Korea.An official of a foreign listed company said, \"I had a heartache because of China\\'s ancient island, but I\\'m embarrassed that this happened again,\" adding, \"However, this issue is a problem for some KOSDAQ-listed companies and should not be seen as a problem for all foreign companies.\"Shin Hyun-sang, Kim Byung-deok, and Kim Han-joon, reporters, are sending reservations for today\\'s Hot News Conference Mobile Korea Forum, and my car has been mobilized to the military.Imported car driver Hwangdang Children\\'s Day Memorial Day National Foundation Day holiday High school student commits suicide and sexual assault Kim Hee-jung See-through look swimsuit.The child actor took off his clothes Copyrighted Financial News.

If KRW 100 million of external funds are transfused, they will be able to escape from the capital erosion state.However, financing is not as easy as it used to be. This is because financial authorities are picky about financing. Maxbro decided to push for a paid-in capital increase worth hundreds of millions of won in shareholders' allocation early last month, but eventually withdrew its financing after receiving several requests for correction from the Financial Supervisory Service.Krazebmt, which has been in a state of capital erosion since last quarter, also pushed for a paid-in capital increase after allocating shareholders last month, but withdrew the paid-in capital increase after receiving requests for correction from the Financial Supervisory Service.There are a series of cases where it is reduced to a bypass listing shell or marginal companies are subject to mergers of bypass listing. Recently, management and supervision of bypass listing have been strengthened, and the number of bypass listing companies has decreased significantly, but marginal companies have been steadily becoming bypass listing shells.Newzen I-City, which even filed for bankruptcy, decided last month to be listed indirectly with unlisted company MyTradeMaster. The merger contract was postponed once, but the merger is underway after many twists and turns.In the case of NewGen ICT, it has been designated as a management item due to continuous business losses before corporate tax cuts for less than 100 million won in sales. Financial statements are expected to improve after the merger, as cumulative sales and operating profit are around KRW 100 million and KRW 100 million, respectively, by the month of this year.Gino System also completed its indirect listing early on. G&I, a resource development company designated as a management item due to improper opinions of semi-annual audits, has become a bypass listing shell through a merger with Gino System, a geographic information system company.The company said that if all the problems before the merger are resolved by the end of the year and the financial statements are cleared through paid-in capital increase, it is expected to break away from management stocks with the submission of audit reports for this fiscal year.High-end securities information service Moutu Coupon birth, lowest price of luxury securities broadcasting, free of stock trading fees, today's recommended stock information rises, catchment features, monthly mobile phone bills, securities Tongk Gay Event, Jeong Yeong-il, Real-time News Money Today, no unauthorized reproduction or redistribution\",\n",
       " 'The roundabout listing market froze solid. This is the opposite of what marginal companies were on the market for mergers of bypass listing ahead of the year-end settlement period until last year. It is crucial that financial authorities\\' supervision has been strengthened after the Neo Semitech crisis.According to the Japanese securities industry, GeoMento recently decided to absorb and merge traces to improve its profit structure and increase management efficiency to diversify its business. Upon completion of the merger, the largest shareholder of Geomento will be changed to Kim Hong-chae, the largest shareholder of Trace.The exchange judged that the merger between the two companies constitutes a bypass listing and that Trace meets the bypass listing requirements. Trace is a mobile phone parts manufacturer, and the merger ratio is about Geomeno and Trace.The merger date is next year.Trace\\'s roundabout listing is the first since last month. Since NewGen ICity decided to push for a bypass listing with unlisted company MyTradeMaster on last month, there has been no bypass listing on the KOSDAQ market.However, the bypass listing of Newzen ICity and MyTrade Master was also made after many twists and turns. The decision was first made at the beginning of last month, but the contract was postponed once, and it had difficulties. At that time, Woo was delayed because the financial authorities\\' supervision of the valuation of MyTrade Master became stricter.The quarterly number of bypass listings also reveals this atmosphere. Only dogs, including Geomento, have decided to be listed on the bypass in the quarter. It is about half of the companies that decided to list indirectly in the last quarter. As of this year, the total number of companies that have decided to list bypasses has decreased from last year.The roundabout listing has been sluggish since the beginning of the year. In the quarter, the number of bypass listings decreased more than last year due to cases. The market seemed to recover quickly as the bypass listing increased to the average level due to cases and cases in the quarter, respectively, but it returned to a sluggish state in the quarter.The industry analyzed that strict supervision of financial authorities on corporate mergers is the biggest reason for the contraction of the bypass listing market. In particular, supervision has been further strengthened after Neosemitech, which entered the KOSDAQ market through bypass listing, was expelled with only a large number of investor damage. An industry source said, \"It is no exaggeration to say that the bypass listing market has actually entered a recession after the Neo Semitech crisis,\" adding, \"The market will inevitably shrink further next year due to the introduction of the bypass listing review.\"High-end securities information service Moutu Coupon birth, lowest price of luxury securities broadcasting, free of stock trading fees, today\\'s recommended stock information rises, catchment features, monthly mobile phone bills, securities Tongk Gay Event, Jeong Yeong-il, Real-time News Money Today, no unauthorized reproduction or redistribution',\n",
       " 'Companies designated as management items are having a hard year-end due to worsening financial structure, which are also arranging shares of shareholders who are expected to mate with Dongbunseo Association listed companies to increase sales. This is because if the reasons designated for management items are not resolved by the end of this year, the company will have to go through the process of delisting with submission of monthly business reports next year.KOSDAQ market stocks and securities market stocks have not solved the reason for designating management stocks until the quarter of this year. Management items are designated in the case of losses before corporate tax deductions exceeding equity capital in the recent opening year of less than KRW 100 million in capital erosion rate that falls short of sales standards for sales.Management items that do not meet the sales standards first by cramming performance are busy with executives and employees in charge of sales. Hermes Holdings, which was designated as a management item last year due to less than KRW 100 million in sales in the securities market, is a case in point. Sales of 100 million won more than cumulative sales in this quarter must be raised within the quarter to avoid delisting. Sales officials claimed that they took a breather by winning a 100 million won contract to supply panels after running around in every way. The company said it plans to receive as much advance payment as possible and reflect sales under the contract in the fiscal year.Micro-robot, which has a market capitalization of 100 million won, is also in a hurry. This is because losses before corporate tax deductions, which reach equity capital by the quarter, must be reduced to less than within the quarter.To that end, the company announced that it has signed a contract to supply products worth 100 million won since last month. This is more than double last year\\'s sales.Companies that give up their management rights and have difficulty maintaining their listings due to their own ability to maintain their listings are moving to become shells and avoid them. A case in point is the resource that merged with iron scrap company Garam last month. Garam\\'s performance, which raised sales of 100 million won and operating profit last year, will be reflected in its financial statements, which will resolve losses and capital erosion before corporate tax deductions that continued until the quarter.Newzen I-City, which has been short of KRW 100 million in sales until the quarter and has continued to lose money before deducting corporate taxes, also found a breakthrough in the transfer of management rights. It improved its financial structure by giving away shares worth 100 million won in the company, which became the largest shareholder of NewGen I-Cities last month, aiming to be listed in a roundabout way next month. The company said, \"We are working on server management and network business together, which are major industries, so we will resolve the lack of sales requirements within this year.\"Even this is not easy for some companies. MB Seongsan, which has been seeking to sell the company since last month, has cut its capital by half through monthly reductions to reduce the burden on buyers, but has yet to find a suitable investor.There are also cases of desperation, and management stocks in which the largest shareholder sells stocks or gives up listing are also notable in less than the end of the year.Maxbro, which failed to raise all three paid-in capital three times since last month alone, was confirmed that its largest shareholder sold all of its shares this month. Interbro, the largest shareholder, disposed of all of its shares, making individual investors with a stake of . Maxbro is also pushing for a paid-in capital increase in general public offerings worth 100 million won this month, but it is widely expected that the possibility of success is slim as the issuance price of new shares is higher than the current stock price.The presidential election shipbuilding, which suffered losses before corporate tax deductions of 100 million won until the quarter when its equity capital was completely eroded, said, \"It is virtually impossible to attract more than 100 million won in new capital to maintain the listing.\"According to the listing regulations on the exchange, companies subject to delisting due to poor financial structure will go through the delisting process from the day after submitting the business report for the relevant business year. However, in the case of delisting due to insufficient equity capital and capital erosion, the exchange can give an improvement period if the requirement for delisting is resolved by the end of next month, the deadline for submitting a business report.Reporter Noh Kyung-mok and Kang Hyun-woo.Successful Habits Prohibiting Unauthorized Reproduction and Redistribution of Korean Economic Newspapers Copyright in accordance with the Korea Online Newspaper Association\\'s Digital News Usage Rules',\n",

       " 'Human Living, the largest shareholder with related parties, announced its intention to replace True Hour management management, a company-wide resource management system builder.This is the first time that multi-level company Human Living has mentioned the replacement of management since it rose as the largest shareholder last month, drawing attention to the current management\\'s response.An official from Human Living said, \"True Hour management is determined to be weak because they do not have a stake in the company,\" adding, \"We plan to participate in management through temporary shareholders\\' meetings or regular shareholders\\' meetings.\"Human Living\\'s intention to directly engage in True Hour management came as the current management had strong doubts about the background of its attempt to merge with Expan, a subsidiary owned by True Hour. Human Living canceled the merger by expressing its opposition to True Hour management.It is in accordance with the regulations that small-scale mergers are withdrawn if the stakeholder expresses opposition under the Commercial Act.True Hour spent hundreds of millions of won last month to acquire shares in Expan and decided to merge last month. This is because it is planning to increase sales, expand business areas, and enter new businesses through mergers. Expan recorded sales of 100 million won last year. Operating profit and net profit are around 10,000 won and 10,000 won, respectively.True Hour posted an operating loss of 100 million won and a net loss of 100 million won last year. Management\\'s logic is that the merger helps improve True Hour performance.Human Living said, \"We have only 100 million won left as of the end of the quarter because we bought Expan for a large amount of money,\" adding, \"We are suspicious of why we are pushing ahead with the merger despite the fact that the company\\'s performance is reflected in the True Hour financial statements.\"He added, \"If we can sell Expan, we should secure cash through sale and strengthen our internal stability,\" and added, \"If we merge, we could lose this opportunity forever.\"Many minority shareholders of True Hour are in favor of Human Living\\'s claim. Small shareholders have opened a cafe and are demanding the resell of their shares in Expan.Meanwhile, the fraud and embezzlement of CEO Jeon, who caused the stock price to plunge in a short period of time last month, is a private matter between CEO Jeon and outsiders, and is considered to have nothing to do with True Hour. It is known to shareholders that True Hour money has disappeared as True Hour revealed the size of the individual transmission to about 100 million won through a public announcement.Human Living has also expressed doubts about this to True Hour management. This is because stock prices could plunge due to concerns over delisting.A True Hour official said, \"Former CEO Jeon was involved in a company-related lawsuit and the company\\'s money was not subject to embezzlement.\" The official added, \"It is regrettable that the merger to improve performance has been canceled,\" adding, \"Even if we sell Expan, we have no idea what plans we have for the sale.\"Assuming that a management dispute occurs, it is difficult to predict the pattern of the dispute as it is not known whether True Hour\\'s current management holds a stake. This is because the report shows that the current management does not hold a stake.A True Hour official did not mention the countermeasures, saying that it had already been predicted as Human Living announced its participation in management for the purpose of holding shares.

       " 'Companies that have been delisted are filing a series of injunctions to prevent the process of delisting.Maxbro said he submitted an injunction to the Seoul Southern District Court to ban the delisting process.Maxbro is a KOSDAQ company that has been banned from trading stocks since last month due to reasons for the rejection of audit opinions by accounting firms, and has been in liquidation since the listing committee decided on the last day.Maxbro submitted an objection to the Korea Exchange and demanded a re-audit to Hankyung Accounting Corp., an accounting firm, but it was not accepted. Separately, the former management is trying hard to escape the mourning by filing criminal charges on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust and disclosing plans for a paid-in capital increase.An official of Maxbro said, \"The reason for delisting occurred due to the former management\\'s fault, and the former management decided that it was inappropriate for the same accounting firm to issue an audit opinion because of uncertainty and contingency debt.\"Like Maxbro, True Hour, which began liquidation trading on the same day, filed an injunction to ban the proceeding of the closing process on the past day.True Hour also changed the company\\'s name to Ocean Global after the reason for the delisting occurred, and went through a paid-in capital increase resolution to submit an objection, but eventually asked the court for help when the delisting was confirmed.However, the prevailing opinion is that the court is unlikely to accept the injunction filed by these companies. In the meantime, a number of similar applications have been filed, but the court has never accepted them.An exchange source said, \"It is believed that the company intends to reduce pressure on shareholders to file an injunction in line with the timing of the liquidation sale,\" adding, \"It is unlikely to be overturned because it is an issue based on the audit opinion of the accounting firm.\"Meanwhile, Maxbro was trading in liquidation as of the afternoon, with True Hour falling against the plunging won.High-end securities information service Kia Motors\\' strategy to open a small car, and Samsung Electronics is full of price, and Samsung Electronics is trying to buy 100 million won in stock prices.

       " 'The list of companies that exit the mid-market is outlined.Ahead of the deadline for submitting audit reports, companies that have been notified of rejection of audit opinions, which are the reasons for delisting, have emerged one after another. Some companies are on the verge of amortization due to capital erosion, and fear of withdrawal is reviving.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, listed companies that have been notified of rejection of audit opinions so far have total changes, including KOSPI and KOSDAQ.At the KOSDAQ, Artis was notified of rejection by the KOSPI by True Hour Science Nexus Investment, Cheil Chang-tu, and Central Design Storm & F Seven Cospe Maxbro.Science recorded operating losses of KRW 100 million last year, reaching an ideal capital erosion rate, and True Hour is a marginal company that is in total financial difficulties, with prosecutors investigating former management\\'s breach of trust in continuous deficits.In particular, in the case of Cheil Changtu, the accounting firm submitted a statement of reasons that it rejected the opinion, but it was changed to an appropriate opinion, causing controversy by the exchange launching an investigation into rumors of intimidation.In addition, as of the deadline for submitting the audit report, the number of listed companies that have not submitted the audit report amounts to a total of KOSDAQ and KOSPI.Among them, individual companies such as Cellen PLC and Gino System, which will hold shareholders\\' meetings before this month, have already passed the deadline for submitting audit reports.Stock market headquarters and KOSDAQ market headquarters are expected to further increase the number of companies that are kicked out due to audit opinions, demanding that Alti Electronics, EK Energy, NewGen IC City, and HanWireless Nvix disclose their audit opinions.Auditing opinions are subject to delisting if they are inappropriate or rejected. Listed companies must submit audit reports no later than the day before the general shareholders\\' meeting. In the case of monthly settlement corporations, shareholders\\' meetings must be held by the month, so audit reports must be submitted by the latest date.Companies that hold shareholders\\' meetings this month should submit them no later than Sunday morning, considering that they are considered to be submitted the previous day if they submit them after the deadline.On top of that, companies designated for management items such as Ubitron and Kyungyoon Hydro are also on the brink of exit due to capital erosion.According to the exchange, there were a total of listed companies with monthly settlements that passed the deadline for submitting audit reports last year, including KOSPI and KOSDAQ. On the KOSDAQ, private companies among them were delisted.The exchange will disclose the list of listed companies that have passed the deadline for submitting audit reports, designate them as management items if they exceed the deadline for submitting business reports at the end of the month, and take the delisting process if they fail to submit them within the next day. The audit report is an essential attachment to the business report, so failure to submit the audit report actually leads to withdrawal.An official of the Korea Exchange said, \"The current trend is similar to last year\\'s by strengthening the delisting regulations so far that many marginal companies have been expelled.\"Inaccessible high-end securities information service After earthquake, investment, commandment, shipbuilding, etc. The identity of the Icheon temporary license plate small car is that convenience store Gimbap is a stock market, military diapers, etc',\n",

       " 'The stock market is a melting pot where the desire for money is boiling. It has a plaque of sound business financing, but it is also a bloody battlefield that determines the fate of companies and individuals.So the stock market is always mixed with joy and joy, and sighs and cheers intersect. The fruits of victory are sweet and the pain of defeat is bitter. We look at the stock market, another microcosm of human history, through reading the stock market from the perspective of ordinary investors. We will point out the front and back of the stock market and turn it upside down and scratch the itchy back of investors.In the wake of the savings bank crisis these days, the word \"crazy\" often goes up and down in the financial market. Originally, Makjang is a term that refers to the end of the mine at the innermost part of the mine, and is often used as a metaphor for a hopeless situation where it is difficult to get as far as it can go and find hope. Such a negative noun has expanded its reach to the financial sector following life\\'s political drama.The absurd behavior of Busan Savings Bank, which has been revealed one by one as if the skin of onions has been peeled off due to the prosecution\\'s investigation, is not surprising. Rather than monitoring major shareholders who used their customers\\' money as if they were eating, all employees who took out money from major shareholders threatened to report illegal withdrawal of deposits just before the suspension of parachute audits.The damage is not omni-directional, like institutional banks, so it does not cause social problems, but the crazy dramas surrounding the stock market are not interrupted.They include abolishing the listing of major shareholders who gained large sums by selling their shares after spreading false information, or taking over non-capital companies by issuing paid-in capital increase or corporate bills just before applying for court receivership. An employee of the Financial Supervisory Service, who received hundreds of millions of won in response to a request to approve the issuance of convertible bonds quickly, is also a major character in the stock market\\'s crazy play.Recently, many KOSDAQ companies such as C-Motech, Gloworks, D-Fashion, and True Hour have become the mainstay of the drama.The harmful effects of reckless behavior are directly linked to a crisis of trust. The case of Jeil Savings Bank, where the bank run occurred, is a good example. As trust in the supervisory system falls, it is useless for financial authorities to shout that it is only a personal corruption of executives.The stock market, which is sensitive to the slightest rumor, is perfect. Bank deposits are protected up to 10,000 won no matter how much the division is, but in the stock market, if the invested company goes wrong, the stock certificate they hold turns into a day\\'s rest. Unlike banks, the exit will be carried out quickly. Depending on the audit opinion of the accounting firm, companies that are ostensibly in surplus may disappear from the stock market.The consequences of every choice involve responsibility. The choice in the stock market is investment and the result is profit. Unlike bank deposits, Hari risk high returns are possible, so most of the responsibility is up to the person who chooses.The problem is that in order for the principle of self-responsibility to be accepted, the law of the game must be clearly applied. Foul acts such as market price manipulation that exploits information asymmetry or immoral management of children who die and live alone must be thoroughly screened and punished to reduce the blame of others and maintain trust. In the same vein, the authorities introduce a substantial review of delisting and expand market monitoring functions.The confusion is uncontrollable if a sham is generalized in front of and behind the stock market. You can watch crazy dramas while cursing, but if it becomes a crazy stock market, investors\\' lives can be uprooted.Private news agency news.

       " \"The resource war is not a distant future.In the wake of the territorial dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku Islands, China secretly suspended exports of rare earths and received Japan's unconditional surrender in a day. Rare earth, which is essential for manufacturing high-tech products, is currently occupying the supply of rare earth metals at low prices since the 1980s, and the world is tense as it is threatening diplomacy with resource weapons.China Venture, a Chinese investment consulting firm as well as supply, announced that the total amount of acquisitions revealed during Chinese companies' overseas resource acquisitions last year reached US$ billion dollars. This is more than double the annual foreign direct investment in the resource energy sector announced by the government.In addition, the London Metal Exchange, which opened after the Christmas holiday last year, recorded $ per ton of electric copper water. It rose in a month, and last year's growth rate reached a whopping . Macquarie, an Australian financial firm, predicted a shortage of 10,000 tons in the electric copper market this year, saying demand for electric copper in advanced countries has risen and China's inventories have fallen to the bottom. At this point, the competition to secure resources around the world is not a silent war, but a fierce war between countries and companies. These days, Korea has signed an agreement with Bolivia to develop lithium to secure various resources and is carrying out a project to explore Zimbabwe's chromium, Zambia, and manganese, but the reality is that it is not as ready as Japan.In preparation for this, Maxbro, a KOSDAQ-listed company, recently signed an exclusive purchase contract for electric copper amounting to 10,000 tons per year from Laos. The total supply of electric copper due to Maxbro's exclusive purchase contract will reach 10,000 tons as of next year, which is close to about 10,000 tons of supply shortage in the electric copper market. Maxbro CEO Kim Jung-hoon said that the electric copper supplied from Laos will be the highest quality manufactured by Australia's world-class resource company Gashundo, mining at Langsang Mineral Mine in Laos, and will be exclusively supplied to all countries in need of electricity demand. The government and private companies should recognize that securing resources is an important keyword for the nation's survival, and the government should continue to provide funds to secure necessary resources, and give tax benefits or incentives to private companies or individuals.

Some expect the possibility of a successful capital increase due to favorable factors, but concerns are also high as it has repeatedly failed in the small paid-in capital increase conducted earlier.In fact, Maxbro recently conducted a paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million in general public offerings, but failed to subscribe. In addition, the paid-in capital increase in student allocation, which was conducted in the middle of the month, was also canceled due to the non-subscription of those eligible for the allocation, and only half of the public offering worth 100 million won was raised due to lack of subscription.The lack of funding for Interbro, the largest shareholder of Maxbro, is also raising concerns. Interbro, which has been in the red for the past year in a row, is in a state of capital erosion.An analyst said, \"We need to be extra careful because there is a possibility of delisting management stocks,\" adding, \"We need to examine the contents of companies more closely and invest in them rather than making favorable disclosures.\" Application launch celebration iPhone Galaxy\\'s free housing pension has increased significantly after Chuseok.

As they discovered soaring stocks on the same day and traded them quickly, members of Seojangsa Cafe enjoyed profits rather than feeling anxious, and said that the best expert for the market now is Seoil, the head of the school.Of course, there is a disadvantage in trading soaring stocks that do not make large profits from long-term holdings in the upward trend market, but in these days' markets, it is very advantageous because short-term bat management is rather risk management.Just because Seo Il-kyo, the director of the Jumsang Club Shortcut Book, makes a short-term sale of soaring stocks, does not mean that he makes a short-term sale even in the upward trend market. Director Seo's investment principle is that if the market changes, the investment method should also change. Therefore, since the direction of the index is unstable and the direction of the index is not set, it is said that if the direction of the market is set, the management plan, such as the period of investment stocks, will change depending on the market.Director Seo Il-kyo's free broadcasting during the day advises that the market is expected to be mixed at the end of the year, but there are one or two stocks that must soar in the market, so profits are always possible, and investors must also manage risks.It is no exaggeration to say that he is the best mentor to make a profit on the current market, just as he recently recommended Yuseong TNS for free and sold it at the upper limit price on the day.Today's Money Today broadcast is free of charge during the day, and please participate and check the profits yourself.

Although the company was handed over to creditors due to the group\\'s worsening management, its performance as well as stock prices are on the rise as management is normalized this year.Kumho Petrochemical has set its sales at KRW trillion this year, higher than its original target, and its performance is expected to continue for the time being as the petrochemical industry is booming. In addition, the management of creditors is expected to end by the middle of next year, which is expected to show full-fledged growth.In addition, Baeksan Hwaseung R&A Daeho A L showed more than a share price increase, followed by Hwasin SL Dongwon Metal and others.On the KOSDAQ market, SRI Resources recorded more than a return. SRI Resources, which changed its name in the middle of this year, fell to the bottom due to various lawsuits, but its stock price has been approaching the won since it acquired a Russian coal company last month.NetWave and online game companies soared more than once, and Shine Hyundai Information Technology recorded more than a share price increase.There are not only soaring stocks. Loen K, listed on the KOSPI market, lost trust from investors due to the embezzlement and breach of trust of the current CEO in the second half of the year following Jeon\\'s breach of trust at the beginning of the year. As a result, the stock price, which was close to the beginning of the year, is currently at the par value level, and recently, it has failed to raise funds due to the failure of the paid-in capital increase.Daewoo Motor\\'s sales also saw its stock price fall to the beginning of the original level due to capital erosion and delays in split sales, while Keystone Global Cellen Ains also fell more than the original price, causing investors to cry.In the KOSDAQ market, SVH plunged to its original level as stock prices fell more than once due to the continued deficit and the CEO\\'s alleged breach of trust. SVH is currently suspended from trading. On top of that, Maxbro and Storm NF MC L&C Corp. are also recording more than a drop in stock prices.The fall in stock prices was at least affordable. There are also many stocks that have embarrassed investors by being kicked out of the market. This month, MCTCore was delisted due to financial losses due to the CEO\\'s embezzlement and breach of trust, and last month, E&T Taek & Testec Hydrogen Power and others were named on the exchange.This year, the number of stocks that have been withdrawn from the market has reached the limit.Inaccessible high-end securities information service \"Mutu Coupon\" is born, using the lowest price of luxury securities broadcasting, free of stock trading fees, today\\'s recommended stock information rises, and features a monthly mobile phone bill discount',\n",

       " 'Ahead of the end of the year, KOSDAQ marginal companies are struggling to survive.These marginal companies work the most to lower the capital erosion rate of more than KRW 100 million in sales.According to the securities industry, Neurotech, which had sales of only 100 million won last year, has recently announced supply contracts one after another. Neurotech signed a contract with Ubia C on the last day to supply wired Internet phones worth 100 million won and announced a contract to manufacture a display system worth 100 million won.Although the contract amount is not large considering that it is a KOSDAQ company, it is not small for Neurotech. Compared to Neurotech\\'s recent sales, this contract is .The reason why Neurotech has released a series of sales announcements this month is that sales contracts are so important under the current situation.Neurotech was designated as a management item due to its sales of only KRW 100 million last year and less than KRW 100 million. Although the capital erosion rate was lowered to . and the continuing business loss rate to equity capital was not high, it was inevitable to designate a management item due to a lack of sales.Furthermore, if sales fall short of 100 million won this year, it could be delisted.There are also many companies that reduce capital through capital reduction or expand funds through paid-in capital increase.KOSDAQ companies that have announced their plans for reduction since the end of last month include HLB, Hissel Jaeyoung Solutec, Barunson Telrod, and MC Testec.In addition, deficit companies such as Storm & F Max Brotozai Holdings and aroma soft have pushed for or are pushing for a paid-in capital increase to improve their financial structure.Kraze Industrial Development and others are simultaneously conducting capital increase for potatoes and paid-in. Storm & F also carried out a paid-in capital increase as soon as the potatoes were finished.Ahead of the end of the year, KOSDAQ companies are cutting back on sales, which has been repeated every year.The Korea Exchange urges individual investors to pay attention to the fact that marginal companies disclose a lot of capital reduction from every month to the following month.An official from the securities industry explained, \"In the past, the government conducted a reduction in capital reduction just before submitting an audit report, but recently, the government is trying to lower the capital erosion rate a little early, perhaps due to fear of delisting.\"The official added that investors will have to carefully check the risk factors as there will be more disclosures about the capital increase paid for potatoes at the end of the year.Reporter Lee Jung-hee.

       " \"Upgrade the publication reading series of popular early releases of Money Today. Reading the disclosure is still evaluated as the basis for disclosure investment by in-depth analysis of the disclosure content, which is the most basic data for investment judgment. We hope that you will build a framework for successful investment through reading public announcements learned in scientific and vivid examples.OraBiotics, a former Palacospi-listed company that was hit by a bomb blast, set a record for a surge last month. Following the previous day, it rose more than two days in a row due to a consecutive trading day.This was possible because price limits were not applied during the clearance sale period.Even so, it is not common sense to buy stocks that are about to leave the stock market at high prices. Although delisting does not mean that stocks are a scrap of paper, most delisting companies are difficult to manage due to bankruptcy, and even opportunities to raise funds that can be enjoyed as open companies disappear.Given that few companies have appeared again after being delisted, it is not an exaggeration to say that delisting is actually a death sentence. The abolition of the listing after coming up empty-handed and going down empty-handed means that stocks can no longer be bought and sold in the securities market or KOSDAQ market. This means that investors will not be able to cash in by selling their stocks easily and quickly, and companies will be blocked from easily raising funds.If listed, there are not many regulations and obligations that follow, but the biggest reason why most companies are struggling to try and maintain listing is that financing is easier. Investments that do not charge interest from an unspecified number of people can be collected by issuing paid-in capital increase or stock-related bonds.Open corporations can issue new bonds such as bonds with interest participating bonds and exchange bonds in addition to bonds with convertible bonds. The issuance limit is also higher than that of unlisted companies.Various corporate-related procedures such as convening a general shareholders' meeting and incinerating treasury stocks will also be simplified. Public relations effects and employee morale can also be expected incidentally. It is a benefit that companies want to enjoy forever.From the perspective of shareholders, listing and delisting are also very different. If the listing is abolished, it will be difficult to buy and sell stocks and sometimes the cost of trading will increase. Unlisted stocks are subject to capital gains tax regardless of major shareholders and minority shareholders, but listed stocks are exempt from capital gains tax.In some cases, minority shareholders are trying to prevent delisting themselves, like C-Motech, which caused a stir in the stock market in the first half of the year. C-Motech also received a month-long improvement period as minority shareholders came forward to collect their shares and apply for objections. The main criteria for the delisting of such companies due to damage are the restriction on the transfer of stocks that have not been submitted due to improper or unfaithful disclosure of opinions, such as insolvency of documents, lack of liquidation, capital, and audit opinion.In particular, with the introduction of a substantial review of delisting in the month of last year, delisting has increased significantly. The actual review is a system that allows companies to be expelled at any time if they are ineligible for listed companies such as accounting fraud or embezzlement, even if they do not meet the existing delisting criteria such as failure to submit audit reports and erosion of capital.Even if the problematic company manages to avoid being expelled from the audit, the possibility of being subject to a real examination has increased. The number of companies delisted due to substantive screening increased from years to years.In the case of accounting audits, audit opinions are divided into appropriate government-appropriate rejection of opinions. Among them, rejection of audit opinions and inappropriate judgment are grounds for delisting. If the company does not file an objection within a day, the delisting process will proceed.Listed companies that have received limited audit opinions will be designated as management items and their listing will be abolished if they are limited twice in a row. On the KOSDAQ market, there were several companies that were delisted due to the rejection of audit opinions. Companies that have been confirmed to abolish the magic or virtual listing of liquidation trading are given a daily liquidation trading period. In other words, shareholders will be given the last chance to cash in before the stock market. It is easy to think whether anyone will buy stocks that will be kicked out, but sometimes the period when active transactions are made as much as the listing period and stock prices soar is the clearance sale period. The reduction of the clearance sale period from work to work was also aimed at preventing such abnormal overheating.In addition to Orabiotics, which was mentioned earlier, Unitech Electronics' Seven Cospe G&R Nexus Investment Nvix showed a floundering stock price during the liquidation sale period.Many of the reasons why stocks of stocks that are about to be withdrawn are traded are to take advantage of the fact that the trading period is limited to work and there is no price limit. During the liquidation and sale period, unfounded rumors such as articles introducing the technology of liquidation and sale and mergers and acquisitions of the court's rehabilitation judgment can be seen on some Internet stock cafes and securities portal sites.It is a common method to raise stock prices with so-called bomb-spinning, attract attention, and sell them when follow-up sales gather and the stock price rises further. Securities experts point out that most of them are speculative trading and cannot be seen as normal trading.There is also a long-term investment-type sale aimed at reviving the company by normalizing its business soon, although it will be delisted for the time being delisted. A typical case is that they have core technologies despite worsening financial structure or embezzlement of executives.This is the case, which has been delisted due to embezzlement by the company's representative and rejection of audit opinions. It was acquired by Dongbu Hannong as it was highlighted that it had an unrivaled technology called eco-friendly pest control technology. Daesun Shipbuilding, which was delisted due to losses in derivatives, saw its stock price rise sharply during the liquidation sale period on expectations that it could be re-listed in the long run due to its existing business network.In addition, if the company has a lot of assets left, it may buy stocks for the sale of assets. It is calculated that it will buy delisted companies at a bargain price to make profits from tangible assets such as land and buildings.Samsung is doing so well, but Sony wanted to give up its used car prices before the launch of its new car, Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Bettman is about to transform into an eco-friendly electric car\",\n",
       " \"C-Motech, which had drawn attention due to the CEO's suicide and President Lee Myung Bak's involvement in relatives, avoided eviction from the stock market, but there are still many obstacles to overcome.The Korea Exchange of Japan said that the listing committee has not decided to delist C-Motech, but has decided to give it an improvement period by the coming month and then make a final decision on delisting.As a result, C-Motech will be able to revive the spark for maintaining its listing, unlike Eco Solution, which was confirmed to be kicked out due to the same reason, refusal of the audit opinion. The reason why the listing committee gave C-Motech an improvement period is that Shinyoung Accounting Corporation, which rejected the audit opinion, decided to re-audit C-Motech. Shinyoung Accounting Corporation is required to resubmit its audit opinion on C-Motech by the day of the transaction after the end of the improvement period. If an inappropriate rejection of justice is made even after a re-audit, or an audit report is not released by the deadline, C-Motech will be finally delisted.Even if C-Motech receives an audit opinion that it is appropriate within the deadline, there are many mountains to overcome. This is because the embezzlement and breach of trust that occurred last month requires a substantial review of delisting. C-Motech said Kim Chang-min, the real owner of Namu Equity and Namu Equity, the largest shareholder, embezzled and betrayed 100 million won in company funds.Meanwhile, C-Motech was rejected as a WiBro handset manufacturer, and two days later, CEO Kim killed himself and made people feel sorry for him, and the former CEO of Namu Equity was reported to be President Lee Myung Bak's nephew-in-law.Reporter Lee Junhee...I can't believe the popularity article of I-dot-com in Korea, the world's biggest mogul, was shocked by Korea, and the world's best salivating Kia Motors was so powerful that their blood was hotHe looks like his runaway wife, and he's taking part in an investment briefing to select promising items by theme\",\n",

       " 'Pay more attention to Samhwa Savings Bank than Busan Savings Bank, which is suspected of being involved in power influence due to the corruption of Samhwa Savings Bank. It is a story that flows around the prosecution.As the investigation into Samhwa Savings Bank progresses, people related to the current government are being mentioned. This suggests that the savings bank gate can be developed into a power-type corruption through Samhwa Savings Bank.Chung Jin-seok, a former outside director of Samhwa Savings Bank, has already been criticized for his involvement in President Lee Myung Bak\\'s nephew-in-law. Former and current lawmakers, including Rep.

This is because the factors that could cause the funeral are scattered like a minefield.The CEO\\'s embezzlement and breach of trust alone is the reason for delisting.

Since Kim Tae-sung, CEO of C-Motech, committed suicide last month, the substance of the tree equity has been considered a key link to reveal why Kim made an extreme choice.Namu Equity is the starting point of a series of non-capital mergers and acquisitions, from last year\\'s acquisition of C-Motech to early this year\\'s acquisition of Samhwa Savings Bank.C-Motech said in a disclosure that Kim and Lee are believed to have caused financial losses to the company by managing C-Motech\\'s corporate seal and bank accounts, causing about 100 million won in property damage, including the amount of seizure.In the end, the lump sum of money, which had been unknown, such as the paid-in capital increase of KRW 100 million, disappeared from the hands of Kim and Lee.According to the disclosure, Namu Equity is a special purpose corporation for mergers and acquisitions established by Jeon, known as President Lee Myung Bak\\'s nephew-in-law, last month with a capital of 10,000 won. After the acquisition of C-Motech, Jeon joined C-Motech, followed by CEO Kim Tae-sung as CEO of Namu Equity.Jeon and Kim Tae-sung appear on the front, but behind them are Kim and Lee, who are quite known as corporate hunters in the market.Kim is said to have been responsible for the establishment of Namu Equity and the acquisition of C-Motech, and Lee is known to have been in charge of financing the private loan market.Lee Cheol-soo is also known to have used the name Lee Sung-min in the past, as well as an alias.

Among them, it is estimated that most of the cases received and cited this year have already been seized.In these bond seizure and collection order cases, the late CEO of C-Motech Kim Tae-sung is almost the debtor. Creditors have a number of individual names, including SJ Investment Partners GMK Asset, Kim and Jung.A large number of foreclosure C-Motech, including capital loan sharks, have been ordered to seize everything from last weekend to office furniture. C-Motech attracted KRW 100 million through a paid-in capital increase last month and issued KRW 100 million in private equity last month, invested by Capital Samhwa Savings Bank Kyungeun Savings Bank.Capital, which failed to recover its principal when C-Motech was on the verge of being kicked out, reportedly exercised put options and applied for seizure to pay back its investment principal for the first time in years.Samhwa Savings Bank, which invested 100 million won with Capital, also invested 100 million won in C-Motech convertible bonds in the previous month and received repayment of principal and interest in the first month in months, and invested 100 million won again the following month. Prosecutors sought an arrest warrant for Shin Sam-gil, a major shareholder of Samhwa Savings Bank, while investigating allegations of illegal loans by Samhwa Savings Bank.Shinhan Capital and Double U Savings Bank, which also invested 100 million won in private equity, avoided the anger. C-Motech paid back 100 million won in investment principal of Shinhan Capital and Double U Savings Bank with the money issued last year.The industry estimates that many creditors in individual names are private lenders. In fact, most of the creditors who filed the bond seizure and collection order are individuals, including Kim, Jung, Song, Kwon, and Roh.C-Motech has been filing bond seizure and collection orders since last month. On the day before CEO Kim's death, a bond seizure and collection order filed with the Seoul Central District Court was received for C-Motech. Since then, private creditors of SJ Investment Partners GMK Asset have applied for seizure one after another.Banks, securities, and countries are collecting bonds, especially creditors, who have seized not only business partners such as commercial banks and securities firms Telecom, but also the state as debtors.The reason for the seizure of Woori Bank, Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, and Citibank Korea is believed to be to seize any bank in the city if there is a balance in C-Motech's account. In particular, there is a possibility that the capital increase payment of 100 million won may be in the air due to seizure even before the paid capital increase is paid.Securities firms such as Dongyang Securities, Kiwoom Securities, Daewoo Securities, and Woori Investment & Securities are also seen as a stepping stone to seize C-Motech shares and J-Com shares acquired by C-Motech. In fact, C-Motech reportedly proposed to provide J-Com shares as collateral in order to lend 100 million won to the pharmaceutical company. In fact, many of the cases of seizure orders fall under stock seizure orders, and Han Kwang-sun, CEO of DAP Holdings Co., Ltd., which acquired JCOM, is also included in the debtor.In addition, it is observed that creditors attempted to recover sales bonds to Telecom, project deposits to the state, or sales tax refund bonds.C-Motech is mainly producing Telecom's login and Wi-Bro terminals. Recently, it is developing products related to Long Term Evolution, a next-generation communication technology.

       " 'C-Motech, which made a paid-in capital increase two months before receiving a rejection from an accounting audit. Amid various suspicions raised after the CEO committed suicide, attention is focused on the existence of paid-in capital increase funds.As a result of the report, it was confirmed that escrow was applied to the gift fund. The conditions were put forward by the company and the main management to meet the level of the FSS, which has the final right to permit the paid-in capital increase. If this escrow has been maintained, there will be a bequest fund left, but if not, there will be a bigger impact.Escrow is a conditional transfer certificate that promises to deposit a specific object to a disciple and deliver it to the other party when certain conditions are met.If escrow had been applied to C-Motech\\'s paid-in capital increase, it can be interpreted that C-Motech would not have been able to use the funds at will.An official from the Financial Supervisory Service said, \"At the time, small shareholders raised questions about C-Motech\\'s paid-in capital increase, and C-Motech voluntarily said it would do escrow considering this.\"The official added that he said he would apply escrow to a large portion of the payment because some of the paid-in capital increase had to be used immediately.An official at Dongbu Securities Co., the chief organizer of C-Motech\\'s paid-in capital increase, said, \"When writing the report, the FSS asked us to apply escrow to ensure the purpose of using the funds.\" Although there are differences in the explanations of the two sides, it is possible to analyze that escrow has reached a consensus.If so, will the paid-in capital increase, which is filled with protective devices called escrow, be preserved?Looking at the purpose of using the funds in the securities report submitted by C-Motech, KRW 100 million was to be used to repay loans and corporate bonds. Short-term borrowing of KRW 100 million seems to have repaid the funds borrowed through Dream Savings Bank of Seoul Savings Bank due to the delayed capital increase. The repayment date of this fund was the month after the date of payment of the capital increase.However, it is estimated that corporate bonds worth 100 million won have not yet been repaid. This is because the expected date of use of the funds in the declaration form is on the date of the month. The corporate bonds are held by three companies, Capital, Samhwa Savings Bank, and Kyungeun Savings Bank, respectively, worth 100 million won. Except for short-term bonds worth 100 million won, there is a high possibility that the escrow was caught in the 100 million won.However, there is a testimony that C-Motech pushed for a project to establish an overseas cement plant during the audit process and tried to use the funds required for it as a bequest fund.C-Motech\\'s remarks are said to have said it would release escrow for the project. Overseas projects are not a condition to solve escrow. This is because it does not fall under the purpose of using funds. If solved, there is a problem.If the paid-in capital increase is used for other purposes and disappeared, the impact of the situation will inevitably increase.

The search for truth is expected to begin in earnest amid the death of CEO Kim, who knew the whole story of the C-Motech scandal.The place where CEO Kim made the extreme choice of how to put out the tangled thread was his vehicle. It's a top-of-the-line Mercedes. The vehicle was leased by J-Com, a KOSDAQ company acquired by C-Motech, not owned by CEO Kim or C-Motech. This is why Jacob employees went out to find CEO Kim.The industry believes that CEO and executives appointed after JCOM was acquired by C-Motech and Namu Equity are from Namu Equity. C-Motech employees also say that J-Com was rather the influential figure in managing funds.It is worth noting that the accounting firm's refusal of audit opinions points to the status of accounting management rather than the financial statements themselves.As paper companies are located in the governance structure leading to Namu Equity C Motec DAP Holdings JCom, it is highly likely that it was difficult to confirm the exact details and routes of the fund execution. The complex governance structure is believed to have affected the situation, given that Shinyoung Accounting Corporation did not take much issue with Jacob before the acquisition.Lee Sang-hoon, the current head of C-Motech's finance division, signed the internal accounting manager's operational evaluation report in question.The paid-in capital increase remains, but the biggest concern for shareholders is the existence of the paid-in capital increase conducted this year. Last month's capital increase of KRW 100 million came into the company after the settlement date.The audit report of the accounting firm is based on the date of last year's settlement. The bequest funds are not subject to audit by the accounting firm.It is observed that the paid-in capital increase has existed until recently. C-Motech tried to push ahead with the J-Dong communication business based on the funds, but it failed due to the Korea Communications Commission's disapproval. Since then, investment in a project to build an African cement plant was considered as a new project, and a deal was made even just before CEO Kim's death.Officials involved in the deal said they held talks with C-Motech and its major shareholder, Namu, and the problem arose just before the billion won investment reached the final stage of agreement. At this time, officials say that the actual owner of the tree equity was also revealed on the surface. Rumor has it that it was an early greeting.Some say that CEO Kim was the so-called pants boss who replaced him. One employee said the company's funds were entirely managed by Tree Equity.These issues are expected to be intensively discussed by minority shareholders at the shareholders' meeting scheduled for this coming day.

       " \"Although the controversy over his nephew's son-in-law has reignited, KOSDAQ market has been stirred by rumors of C-Motech as KOSDAQ companies have been exposed, including a lack of transparency in business expansion due to the spread of politics. As CEO Kim of C-Motech, who is on the verge of being kicked out, died of suicide on the last day, all kinds of questions have been raised.Given that C-Motech is on the verge of delisting due to the rejection of audit opinions by accounting firms, it is common to interpret that the problems of KOSDAQ companies that lack transparency have been expressed. However, the C-Motech scandal seems to be falling into a mysterious situation beyond the stock market, with some saying that it may be related to Jeon, the nephew of President Lee Myung Bak, who also served as the head of Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of C-Motech.Although it has become a political circle, the starting point for rumors of a political background is Namu Equity, the current largest shareholder of C-Motech. Namu Equity is known as a special purpose company founded by a former man known as President Lee Myung Bak's nephew-in-law last month. With a capital of 10,000 won, Namu Equity became the largest shareholder of C-Motech by acquiring a stake in C-Motech, a wired and wireless communication equipment company, in the same month.After the acquisition, Jeon held a monthly extraordinary shareholders' meeting and started managing C-Motech as a full-time director and CEO Kim as CEO. In addition to manufacturing existing telecommunications equipment, the company added real estate development, sales and rental businesses, management advice for investment businesses, and carbon emission rights for mergers and acquisitions of consulting businesses.In a related move, Rep. Cho Young-taek and Choi Moon-soon of the Democratic Party of Korea raised suspicions that Jeon caused damage to individual investors by taking over C-Motech through Namu Equity and raising stock prices by participating in J-dong Telecom. In fact, last year, Wall C-Motech participated in J-Dong Telecom's stake in Korea Mobile Internet, but failed to secure business rights. Although the J-Mobile telecommunication business failed to start, the stock price jumped and Jeon made a profit in the process. After the controversy, Jeon reportedly withdrew from C-Motech and Namu Equity, which is not related to C-Motech. However, the controversy is likely to ignite once again under speculation that the influence on CEO Kim or C-Motech remained.Critics point out that even if political rumors are excluded from the KOSDAQ company's opacity, KOSDAQ companies' problems such as corruption, which carried out paid-in capital increase despite the crisis of business expansion through excessive management opacity with C-Motech.Shinyoung Accounting Corp. notified C-Motech of its rejection of opinions due to restrictions on the scope of the audit. In the audit report, Shinyoung Accounting Corp. said it was not able to confirm the substance and adequacy of important fund transactions due to the important vulnerabilities of C-Motech's internal control procedures. The company's funds were not treated in an appropriate way, which leads to suspicions that there may have been internal embezzlement.It seems to have helped to move toward the current situation of DoC Motech. Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of C-Motech, borrowed 100 million won in private loans when it took over last month and borrowed additional funds when it acquired J-Com last year. Despite the company's situation, it is also morally reprehensible that it raised KRW 100 million through a paid-in capital increase last month.The damage to minority shareholders, who are suffering from the paid-in capital increase in the month, is serious. When the deal was suspended, C-Motech's stock price was Won. The market capitalization was 100 million won. In particular, on last month, it raised KRW 100 million in paid-in capital increase for individual investors, adding to the damage to shareholders. At that time, the subscription competition rate was high, reaching .dae, and the old shareholder took the paid-in principle because it gave priority to existing shareholders. With the rejection of the audit opinion unclear to maintain the listing, even the CEO's suicide occurred, leaving investors unable to do this or that.C-Motech shareholders are vowing to launch minority shareholders' meetings through online and offline communities and to speak out for normalization of the company by participating in management rights. Voting rights delegation is currently underway for minority shareholders.C-Motech is also seeking self-rescue measures. In order to avoid delisting, it plans to submit an objection to the delisting to the Korea Exchange next month. If you file an objection as scheduled, you will undergo a reexamination process and determine whether it will be finalized or not. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that C-Motech will be rejected by the accounting firm again or will be subject to a substantial review of delisting.Reporter Kim Hyung-sun...\",\n",
       " 'Kim Tae-sung, CEO of C-Motech, a wired and wireless communication device manufacturer, is shocking that he killed himself last evening.The CEO of a listed company that is on the verge of withdrawing from the stock market committed suicide, causing a big shock to executives and company investors.The industry believes that excessive corporate mergers and acquisitions and business expansion eventually led to suicide. The bigger problem is that this suicide is not just the suicide of a KOSDAQ CEO. With the completion of the submission of audit reports at the end of the month, a strong tsunami of exit is expected to hit the KOSDAQ market, where various lawsuits and embezzlement and malpractice continue.C-Motech, which called for the CEO\\'s suicide, according to a company C-Motech, CEO Kim attempted suicide from his vehicle last evening and was taken to a hospital, but eventually died. CEO Kim was found dead near his home in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province, on the last day. A suicide note was also found in the car where CEO Kim attempted suicide. CEO Kim\\'s suicide came two days after C-Motech received a notification from the accounting firm in charge of the past to reject the audit opinion.A company official said he received news of his death over the weekend, but said he did not know how or why he died.However, analysts say that excessive corporate mergers and acquisitions and business expansion eventually led to CEO Kim\\'s suicide.C-Motech is a company that manufactures data modems used when using wireless Internet with laptops. Its main product is a modem that simultaneously supports WiBro, which is an existing mobile communication network, with dual-band mode. Recently, it developed and introduced a product based on Long Term Evolution, a next-generation communication technology.C-Motech has been suffering from losses in foreign exchange derivatives, but its product contract ended at the end of last month. Since then, the company has focused on research and development. In particular, it conducted a paid-in capital increase of 100 million won this month for the purpose of investing in R&D such as developing related products. The paid-in capital increase, in which Dongbu Securities and Woori Investment & Securities participated as organizers, went to shareholders and individual investors without taking over the balance.In other words, investors took on the damage as C-Motech was on the verge of being kicked out due to a refusal of opinions on an audit report within months after raising funds with a paid-in capital increase.Stem cells from electric vehicles...It was in the month of last year that CEO Hwa-geun Kim made his name known to the stock market. It has been since the start of Tree Equity, which specializes in companies. Namu Equity has signed a contract to acquire C-Motech, which commercialized wireless modems such as login for the first time in Korea in months. It was a de facto non-capital raising of KRW 100 million in management rights acquisition by borrowing and capital increase.Since then, CEO Kim has continued to expand his business. C-Motech announced its participation in the electric vehicle business last month. Namu Equity acquired JCOM, which ran a bio business such as stem cells, last month. On Monday, he announced his participation in J-Dong communication through C-Motech. Since the end of last year, it has even pushed for the acquisition of savings banks through JCOM, but it has been canceled due to lack of legal requirements. In pushing for the new project, Namu Equity continued to inject funds from outside. Analysts say that it may have spent at least 100 million won on the acquisition of Jacob. C-Motech conducted a paid-in capital increase of 100 million won this month under the pretext of research and development.In the meantime, President Lee Myung Bak\\'s nephew-in-law, Jeon, served as CEO of Namu Equity and director of C-Motech, and C-Motech was classified as a theme stock. Jeon left the company last month. However, all of these attempts have failed, and C-Motech\\'s stock price has fallen to KRW for the first time in more than a year, and trading has been trading.In the future of C-Motech, securities firms believe that CEO Kim had no choice but to expand his business and touch the company\\'s funds. Shinyoung Accounting Corp., which rejected the opinion, said it could not confirm the substance of the fund transaction due to the company\\'s weak investment and fund management.An official from the securities industry analyzed that it actually means embezzlement.CEO Kim\\'s suicide also cast a dark cloud over the future of C-Motech and J-Com, which are listed companies affiliated with Namu Equity. When the accounting firm first rejected the opinion, C-Motech said it would not be difficult to maintain the listing even if it was embezzled.This is because it made sales of 100 million won last year and made operating profit of 100 million won to turn into a surplus.The C-Motech stake in Tree Equity, which once reached... has shrunk to... The rest are all owned by minority shareholders and are expected to suffer great damage if they are delisted. Jacob\\'s stock price also hit the lower limit for the second consecutive day after C-Motech was rejected.The bigger problem with this year\\'s KOSDAQ exit tsunami is that listed companies inside and outside of the company have been expelled this year.According to the Korea Exchange, the monthly settlement corporation, which caused the delisting due to capital erosion or rejection of audit opinions this year, is all open on the KOSPI stock market and KOSDAQ stock market.Listed companies that have still failed to submit audit reports even after the deadline for submitting the audit report are those that are listed on the KOSDAQ. Considering the cases in which many companies that failed to submit audit reports in time were delisted, it is expected that listed companies in and out of the country will be expelled this year.Last year, a number of new companies, including Neo Semitech, were expelled, and the new companies failed to cross the threshold of accounting audits in the previous four years.Auditing opinions are divided into appropriate government-appropriate rejection of opinions. Among them, the rejection of audit opinions from external auditors is a reason for delisting, and if the company does not file an objection within a day, the delisting process will proceed. So far this year, KOSPI-listed companies and KOSDAQ-listed companies have been notified of their rejection of opinions.Analysts say that the increase in delisting due to accounting audits since year is the result of stricter accounting audits as the real review of delisting was introduced at the beginning of the year. Another reason is that capital erosion has increased as performance has deteriorated since the global financial crisis.The actual review is a system that can be delisted at any time if there is an unqualified reason for listed companies such as accounting fraud or embezzlement, even if they do not meet the existing delisting criteria such as failure to submit audit reports and erosion of capital.An official of a listed company said, \"In the past, if the performance is not serious, we received appropriate opinions easily, but since the audit of accounting firms can be conducted even if they pass the audit, they tend to be stricter than before.\"In fact, the number of companies that were delisted due to the rejection of audit opinions increased from years to last year. In the end, as another monthly exit crisis occurs this year, individual investors are expected to lose money.The Herald Live News. What the hell is a silk scroll...

       " \"CEO Kim of C-Motech, who is on the verge of being kicked out of the KOSDAQ market, died of suicide on the last day.It is analyzed that the cause of CEO Kim's suicide, which was revealed on the surface, is due to stress and pressure caused by the rejection of opinions in the audit report, which became the reason for the KOSDAQ's exit.However, market officials point out that the extreme choice of the CEO of a KOSDAQ-listed company, who has aggressively expanded its business through corporate mergers and acquisitions, shows the chronic problems of the KOSDAQ market and the industry.Stock market officials hope that the authorities will thoroughly cover the cause and background of the incident and prevent a recurrence through institutional supplementation, as cases such as C-Motech are repeated every year. Where is the capital increase? The executives and employees of C-Motech, which is in the shock of the CEO's suicide, did not receive this month's salary, which should have been paid last day. Every piece of furniture in the company has been seized.Where did C-Motech's KRW 100 million raised through a paid-in capital increase last month go?According to Dongbu Securities, which conducted a paid-in capital increase, C-Motech reportedly repaid short-term loans borrowed from Seoul Savings Bank and Dream Savings Bank with KRW 100 million of the paid-in capital increase. In addition, 100 million won was to be used to repay bonds issued at the end of last month. However, this is not yet in a situation where funds will go out for repayment when exercising put options.Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of C-Motech, borrowed hundreds of millions of won in bonds at the time of the acquisition It is also observed that when JCom was acquired last month, additional funds were borrowed, and the capital increase may have been seized due to excessive debts. The specific reason for the rejection of the direct cause of death is the rejection of the audit report's audit opinion, which is the direct reason for CEO Kim's extreme choice of suicide. C-Motech expected to survive as it succeeded in turning into an operating surplus last year, but Shinyoung Accounting Corp. notified C-Motech on the last day of its rejection of opinions due to restrictions on the scope of audit.C-Motech recorded sales of 100 million won, operating profit of 100 million won, and net loss of 100 million won last year. Although it succeeded in turning into an operating profit surplus, the accounting firm rejected the opinion that it could not audit financial statements such as assets and liabilities due to limited scope.The industry believes that C-Motech suffered from debt repayment that was not revealed in the books amid a strict audit of the accounting firm. Like other KOSDAQ marginal companies, minority shareholders are arguing that the management's embezzlement and breach of trust may have been a decisive factor in the rejection of opinions. Namu Equity, the largest shareholder of C-Motech, started last year's acquisition of C-Motech, which is currently C-Motech's largest shareholder. The substance of Namu Equity, which CEO Kim even took charge of, is not known for sure, and some C-Motech employees are also said to have antipathy to Namu Equity.Namu Equity is a special purpose company for mergers and acquisitions with a capital of 10,000 won set up by Jeon, who is known as President Lee Myung Bak's nephew-in-law last month.In the same year, Namu Equity became the largest shareholder of succeeding C-Motech, which was negotiating with the largest shareholder of C-Motech, a KOSDAQ-listed company that produces data modems for mobile communication. After the acquisition, Jeon became a full-time director of C-Motech and CEO Kim was the CEO of C-Motech. During last year's parliamentary audit, Rep. Cho Young-taek and Choi Moon-soon of the Democratic Party raised suspicions that Jeon caused damage to individual investors by raising stock prices by participating in J-dong Telecom after acquiring C-Motech through Tree Equity. At this time, Jeon withdrew from C-Motech's director and Namu.Some raise suspicions that there may be a separate owner of Namu Equity, given that CEO Kim is an unknown person in the field. Currently, Namu Equity's stake in C-Motech has been reduced to . One of the concerns is whether C-Motech will be expelled as it is, but C-Motech will be expelled from the stock market as it is. C-Motech is reportedly requesting a re-audit to Shinyoung Accounting Corp.C-Motech plans to convene a board of directors within this week, when Kim's funeral process is completed, to set up a center point for the new CEO to overcome the crisis.It also plans to submit an objection to the delisting to the Korea Exchange next month to avoid delisting. If C-Motech files an objection as scheduled and goes through the review process, the final decision will be made around next month.Simotech is hoping for the possibility of normalizing the company as its operations are operating normally, although its funding channels are currently tied up due to seizure. C-Motech succeeded in turning into a surplus last year as its annual operating profit surpassed 100 million won. Last month, he won the billion-dollar tower at the ceremony marking the International Trade Day.However, as of the end of the month, cash flow from operating activities was less than 100 million won, and net profit was only 100 million won. In other words, they sold products worth 100 million won per month, but only a small amount of cash was held.However, even if C-Motech is re-audited by an accounting firm in the future, the company is expected to suffer a huge blow from new product development and overseas exports if it is rejected again or the stock market is decided by the delisting review committee. Amid the shock of CEO Kim's suicide, whether it can be recovered from damage to minority shareholders, C-Motech shareholders are vowing to launch a minority shareholder meeting through the online and offline community and voice their normalization of the company by participating in management rights. Voting rights delegation is currently underway for minority shareholders. At the time of the suspension, the original market capitalization of the company reached 100 million won.Many of the minority shareholders have recently fallen in stock prices, adding to the damage caused by their participation in the paid-in capital increase worth KRW 100 million last month. At that time, after the allocation of shareholders, the subscription rate of the old shareholders reached . in the capital increase for the general public offering of forfeited shareholders.C-Motech's minority shareholders said they will normalize the company by forming a CEO and board that shareholders and executives and employees can fully understand by holding a shareholders' meeting on the coming day, adding that they will also take legal measures such as compensation for damages caused to shareholders.It's a high-end securities information service that's not accessible on the news.C-Motech's largest shareholder, Namu Equity, is rekindled by controversy over C-Motech's CEO's suicide and nephew's son-in-law, but even the CEO's suicide C-Motech company's house doesn't get paid by the foreclosure C-Motech employees...Capital increase Where to make a successful investment Today's recommended stock price is small and medium-sized stocks Today's securities information rise Featured by actual competition Winner Song Jung-ryul Kim Dong-hee Reporter Han Eun Copyright 리얼 Real-time News Money Today No unauthorized reproduction or redistribution\",\n",
       " 'Attention is focusing on the background of the death of CEO of C-Motech, an iNews KOSDAQ company. In particular, CEO Kim did not have a single share of C-Motech, and sales reached a record high last year, raising questions about whether he was in a situation where he could make an extreme choice.It was a good start. CEO Kim achieved operating profit of 100 billion won after acquiring C-Motech last year and normalized the company in a short period of time, recording a record 100 billion won in sales.However, the problem began as they pushed too hard to expand their business. C-Motech took over J-Com, a bio company, last year at a cost of more than 100 million won, and announced its participation in the electric vehicle business in the same month, but withdrew it within a few days.In addition, recently, it participated as a major shareholder in promoting the J-Dong telecommunication business, causing controversy over raising funds and possible business. This month, a paid-in capital increase of 100 million won was also carried out in the name of raising research and development costs related to the next-generation wireless communication business.The problem is the path through which company money was used in the process of continuously expanding the business. The audit report submitted by Shinyoung Accounting Corp., which notified the rejection of the audit opinion, said it could not confirm the substance of the fund transaction due to the company\\'s weak investment and fund management.The industry believes that there is a possibility that problems such as embezzlement may have occurred in the process of financing and execution of the company. The industry believes that the vulnerability of fund management, which is the reason for the rejection of audit opinions by accounting firms, makes this guess.An industry source said, \"It is more likely that it is an internal fund control issue than an accounting issue that takes issue with the vulnerability of fund management,\" adding, \"The damage will be done to investors who invested without knowing the internal situation.\"Private loan funds are also blamed for pressuring Kim. When CEO Kim acquired C-Motech through Namu Equity, an investment company, last month, he is estimated to have raised 100 million won out of the total acquisition amount as private loan funds.In addition, some say that CEO Kim may have made an extreme choice because if the listing is abolished, product development and exports with telecommunications companies could be suspended.Lee Bu-yeon. iNews Entertainment Sports is JoyNews, a new visual game, iNews, iNews, iNews, iNews, iNews, iNews, iNews, Newsletter',\n",
       " 'C-Motech, which is on the verge of delisting, is on the verge of drifting as it encounters a major negative factor of suicide of its CEO. According to the industry, Kim, CEO of C-Motech, attempted suicide near Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province, and eventually died. A suicide note was also reportedly found in the car where CEO Kim attempted suicide. CEO Kim\\'s suicide seems to be due to a series of failures in C-Motech\\'s new business, which had been ambitiously pursued, and recently received a rejection of opinions from Shinyoung Accounting Corp. as a result of an audit of last fiscal year. Companies that have received rejection of opinions will go through the process of delisting unless they submit data to overturn the audit results. CEO Kim founded Namu Equity last month, a company specializing in mergers and acquisitions, and acquired KOSDAQ-listed C-Motech within months of its foundation. C-Motech was a manufacturer of wireless modems such as login. After acquiring C-Motech, CEO Kim achieved operating profit of 100 million won last year and normalized sales in a short period of time, recording a record high of 100 million won. However, excessive business expansion has also raised concerns in the market. Last year, C-Motech announced its participation in the electric vehicle business, but withdrew it within a few days, and announced its participation in J-Dong communication in the same month. This month, it also conducted a paid-in capital increase of 100 million won in the name of raising research and development costs related to the next-generation wireless communication business. It is also unknown whether the company\\'s money was managed transparently in the process of CEO Kim expanding his business. Shinyoung Accounting Corp. said in an audit report that it was not able to confirm the substance of the fund transactions due to the company\\'s weak investment and fund management. In this way, cases where the substance of financial transactions is not confirmed often lead to embezzlement by management. A researcher from a stock market said, \"C-Motech\\'s governance structure and future businesses are likely to drift due to the suicide of the CEO, who had been managing it with will,\" adding, \"If we lose our status as a listed company, we are concerned about great damage to individual shareholders.\" Another hospital recommends Park Myung-soo, a plastic surgeon, to stop the exclusive production plant of high-quality Japanese parts and speed up the pace of a judge at a meal Jeon Hyun-moo\\'s past photos are released.

The police believe that CEO Kim took his own life, and an autopsy has been requested by the National Forensic Service to determine the exact cause of death.C-Motech is mindful of the possibility that CEO Kim made an extreme choice after suffering from financial difficulties. C-Motech was notified by Shinyoung Accounting Corp. on the last day that it rejected the audit report and failed to pay the monthly salary of its executives and employees the next day.A C-Motech official said, \"However, we have not been able to understand the financial difficulties at all because our operating profit turned into a surplus last year and the paid-in capital increase was successful,\" adding, \"We have not been able to find out exactly why we rejected the audit report.\"In particular, he explained that he did not know the details of the whereabouts of the billion won worth of funds flowing in through the paid-in capital increase earlier this year.The industry estimates that CEO Kim has been under financial pressure by raising some private loan funds since he acquired C-Motech through Namu Equity, an investment company, last month. Of the acquisition price of 100 million won, 100 million won was raised as private loan funds.Speculation has been raised that CEO Kim may have made an extreme choice because if the listing is abolished due to financial difficulties as well as refusal of opinions on audit reports, product development and exports with telecommunications companies could be suspended.The company plans to convene a board of directors within this week, when CEO Kim\\'s funeral is completed, requesting a re-audit of the CEO and submitting an objection to delisting around next month.\"There is no problem with J-Com\\'s sales, a subsidiary of C-Motech, which is not accessible through news,\" said Kim, CEO of C-Motech, who went to rescue C-Motech, who committed suicide, feeling sorry for his family.Shortcut to successful investment in thin ice KOSDAQ Today\\'s recommended stocks are small and medium-sized stocks Today\\'s securities information rise Featured by the winner of the actual competition Recommended by reporter Joo Eun-hee, copyright holder, real-time news Money Today, no unauthorized reproduction or redistribution',\n",

Today, we will talk about the details of this with reporter Cho Seul-ki.Investors as well as insolvent listed companies must feel like they are walking on thin ice these days, so please clean up the companies that are on the edge of the cliff.As the submission of the KOSDAQ market audit report, which has been stained by various lawsuits for embezzlement and breach of trust by journalists management, is completed, the tsunami of exit is simply strong. It is estimated that there are around 30 companies that will be delisted this year due to accounting audits.Companies on the verge of delisting are currently counted as all companies that have not submitted audit reports due to capital erosion or rejection of audit opinions.Basically, the problem is that underqualified companies easily entered the KOSDAQ market, and the recession of small and medium-sized companies and poor listing management are also blamed for the massive exit.Anchor In this atmosphere, it is shocking to hear that a CEO of a KOSDAQ company committed suicide last weekendReporter: That's right. An incident occurred last weekend in which excessive mergers and acquisitions and business expansion killed the CEO of a KOSDAQ-listed company.Kim Tae-sung, CEO of C-Motech, died last weekend. Currently, according to the bereaved families of hospitals and companies, it has been confirmed that they killed themselves two days after receiving a notice of rejection of the audit opinion of the accounting firm.Investors are also shocked by the news of the company's rejection of the audit decision, which has generated 100 billion won in sales and operating profit since its foundation last year.Anchor. I see. What's the reason why the CEO was driven to suicide? Because he followed in the footsteps of a typical insolvent listed company of reckless business expansion, financial difficulties, and rejection of audit opinions.CEO Kim founded Namu Equity, a specialized company, last year and acquired C-Motech, which commercialized a wireless modem well-known for login, for the first time in Korea within months, drawing attention inside and outside Yeouido Stock Market.Since then, he participated in the electric vehicle business last month and took over JCOM, which ran a bio business such as stem cells, and showed active activities.Since then, he has also participated in a consortium recruiting J-Tong Telecom operators and caused controversy over the possibility of business and funding. At the beginning of the year, it attempted to acquire Samhwa Savings Bank through JCOM, but it was canceled.Anchor, you've shown a variety of moves in recent years. The typical move of insolvent companies is to promote new businesses in various fields.In the process of promoting the new press project, external funds were continuously transfused, and each project that entered the market was underperformed, which led to the worst situation.All of these attempts failed, and the stock price fell to around 1,000 won at the end of last year, and the transaction has been suspended. The news of CEO Kim's suicide is expected to cast dark clouds over the future of C-Motech and J-Com.C-Motech, which is at the crossroads of delisting due to the rejection of the anchor's audit opinion, will inevitably cause damage to investors of the companyReporter: That's right. The news of the CEO's suicide is devastating not only the company's shareholders and employee-related industries, but also stock market officials.The company says that the rejection of the audit opinion is unexpected because the CEO's embezzlement or breach of trust has not occurred and the business is being carried out normally.However, as C-Motech has been driven to the crisis of delisting, if C-Motech is withdrawn from the stock market, the company's total stock price will inevitably be suspended. In fact, if such concerns become a reality, they are expected to suffer the same damage as last year's Neosemitech.Reporter Cho Seulgi...Related information: KOSDAQ's largest shareholder, large amount of damage, large amount of money, stock price manipulation, KOSDAQ CEO, etc., are reported to have escaped the delisting of marginal companies.

The industry also protested that it is a representative desktop administration. According to the Korea Small and Medium Business Administration, the government is pushing for a cost-cutting certification system that certifies cost-cutting efforts by my evaluation agency based on cost data for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, even small and medium-sized companies, which are considered beneficiaries ahead of the implementation of the system, are expressing concerns. An official from a small and medium-sized electronics company that supplies secondary battery parts to large companies said, \"It is not easy to get certified by revealing the cost of trade secrets, and it will be difficult for large companies to recognize the cost reduction.\" There is a lot of anxiety that if they do something wrong, only their costs will be disclosed and actual profits will not be obtained. Large companies also expressed a negative view of the cost reduction certification system. The plan to build a new airport in the southeastern region, where Busan, Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do are tightly opposed, is expected to be scrapped.

       " 'Suspicions are growing over the KOSDAQ-listed company C-Motech, which is on the verge of delisting, as Kim made an extreme choice of suicide on the past day. In particular, as the person who was the largest shareholder of the company by the end of last year was known to be Jeon, the nephew of President Lee Myung Bak, the possibility that the controversy could escalate into a political circle cannot be ruled out.CEO Kim took his own life two days later after receiving a rejection of the opinion of the audit report during a regular accounting audit on the last day. The general observation is that the audit report provided a motive for suicide. However, since the company posted operating profit of 100 million won in sales last year, attention is being paid to what management problems were rejected. It is a surplus in financial statements, but the actual flow of funds was unclear. Small shareholders of C-Motech claim to be Kim\\'s embezzlement.According to the disclosure of the Korea Exchange in Japan, CEO Kim took office in the month of last year. Jeon was the CEO of Namu Equity, which acquired C-Motech a month ago and became the largest shareholder. Namu Equity is a special purpose company established by Jeon for mergers and acquisitions with 10,000 won in capital in the month of last year. Jeon took over C-Motech and became a registered director.CEO Kim of C-Motech and Jeon started to expand their business in earnest from the following year, and first of all, they focused on securing J-Dong telecommunication business rights. Expectations were high because the president\\'s nephew-in-law participated, and stock prices soared from won to won. However, there was a controversy over whether he failed to secure business rights and raised suspicions that he might have raised stock prices by participating in J-Dong\\'s communication during a parliamentary audit last year. Jeon withdrew from Namu Equity and C-Motech late last year. Since then, CEO Kim has taken over as the largest shareholder, and earlier this year, he started to acquire a insolvent savings bank, but returned to nothing.Some in the financial investment industry predict that large-scale debt may have occurred as C-Motech, which manufactures wireless data modems, excessively carried out its business. Minority shareholders also raise suspicions about the whereabouts of the 100 million won paid-in capital increase this month. The reality of Namu Equity, the largest shareholder, is also questionable. An employee of C-Motech said, \"CEO Kim has led the business and Jeon has attracted investment,\" adding, \"We don\\'t know the substance of Namu Equity, which acquired C-Motech.\" As a result, there are suspicions that CEO Kim is just a barge manager who only puts his name on the accounting books.

       " \"The turmoil of listed companies' exit from the stock market continues due to the entry of companies with less anchor content into the stock market and the increasingly strengthened review of delisting.Finally, last weekend, the CEO of a KOSDAQ company, which was on the verge of delisting, took his life. Today, we will talk about the details of this with reporter Cho Seul-ki.Investors as well as insolvent listed companies must feel like they are walking on thin ice these days, so please clean up the companies that are on the edge of the cliff.As the submission of the KOSDAQ market audit report, which has been stained by various lawsuits for embezzlement and breach of trust by journalists management, is completed, the tsunami of exit is simply strong. It is estimated that there are around 30 companies that will be delisted this year due to accounting audits.Companies on the verge of delisting are currently counted as all companies that have not submitted audit reports due to capital erosion or rejection of audit opinions.Basically, the problem is that underqualified companies easily entered the KOSDAQ market, and the recession of small and medium-sized companies and poor listing management are also blamed for the massive exit.Anchor In this atmosphere, it is shocking to hear that a CEO of a KOSDAQ company committed suicide last weekendReporter: That's right. An incident occurred last weekend in which excessive mergers and acquisitions and business expansion killed the CEO of a KOSDAQ-listed company.Kim Tae-sung, CEO of C-Motech, died last weekend. Currently, according to the bereaved families of hospitals and companies, it has been confirmed that they killed themselves two days after receiving a notice of rejection of the audit opinion of the accounting firm.Investors are also shocked by the news of the company's rejection of the audit decision, which has generated 100 billion won in sales and operating profit since its foundation last year.Anchor. I see. What's the reason why the CEO was driven to suicide? Because he followed in the footsteps of a typical insolvent listed company of reckless business expansion, financial difficulties, and rejection of audit opinions.CEO Kim founded Namu Equity, a specialized company, last year and acquired C-Motech, which commercialized a wireless modem well-known for login, for the first time in Korea within months, drawing attention inside and outside Yeouido Stock Market.Since then, he participated in the electric vehicle business last month and took over JCOM, which ran a bio business such as stem cells, and showed active activities.Since then, he has also participated in a consortium recruiting J-Tong Telecom operators and caused controversy over the possibility of business and funding. At the beginning of the year, it attempted to acquire Samhwa Savings Bank through JCOM, but it was canceled.Anchor, you've shown a variety of moves in recent years. The typical move of insolvent companies is to promote new businesses in various fields.In the process of promoting the new press project, external funds were continuously transfused, and each project that entered the market was underperformed, which led to the worst situation.All of these attempts failed, and the stock price fell to around 1,000 won at the end of last year, and the transaction has been suspended. The news of CEO Kim's suicide is expected to cast dark clouds over the future of C-Motech and J-Com.C-Motech, which is at the crossroads of delisting due to the rejection of the anchor's audit opinion, will inevitably cause damage to investors of the companyReporter: That's right. The news of the CEO's suicide is devastating not only the company's shareholders and employee-related industries, but also stock market officials.The company says that the rejection of the audit opinion is unexpected because the CEO's embezzlement or breach of trust has not occurred and the business is being carried out normally.However, as C-Motech has been driven to the crisis of delisting, if C-Motech is withdrawn from the stock market, the company's total stock price will inevitably be suspended. In fact, if such concerns become a reality, they are expected to suffer the same damage as last year's Neosemitech.Reporter Cho Seulgi...Related information: KOSDAQ's largest shareholder, large amount of damage, large amount of money, stock price manipulation, KOSDAQ CEO, etc., are reported to have escaped the delisting of marginal companies.

In particular, it is reported that the borrowed billion won out of the acquisition price continued to pressure CEO Kim and the company.Such undisclosed financial pressure was severe, and it attempted to resolve the financial difficulties by acquiring one more listed company JCOM last month, but it was not easy. C-Motech affiliate J-Com attempted to acquire Samwha Savings Bank this month The acquisition was canceled due to consultations with related laws and related agencies.C-Motech also succeeded in increasing its capital by more than 100 million won and turning its operating profit into a surplus with 100 million won. However, industry officials estimated that the company had difficulty repaying its debts amid a strict audit by the accounting firm.An industry source said, \"We recently received a request from C-Motech and J-Com officials to lend us 100 million won for a month,\" but speculated that the financial difficulties may have led us to make an extreme choice.CEO Kim is an engineer from semiconductor and has served as CEO of C-Motech Tree Equity after serving as CEO of Innovation and Seoul Electronics.Meanwhile, C-Motech is a manufacturer of Telecom login and Wi-Bro terminals.

However, it recorded a net loss of 100 million won in the previous business year and a net loss of 100 million won last year.Stock industry sources point out that excessive business expansion and opaque accounting are the cause. CEO Kim announced his participation in the electric vehicle business last month but reversed it within a day. On Wall, it acquired J-Com, which used to run a bio-business such as stem cells, and on Wall, it announced its participation in J-Dong communication.In this month, it also conducted a paid-in capital increase of 100 million won in the name of raising R&D expenses related to the next-generation wireless communication long-term evolution project. It also attempted to acquire Samhwa Savings Bank through JCOM, but it ran aground.Shinyoung Accounting Corp. said it was unable to confirm the substance and adequacy of important fund transactions due to the company\\'s important weaknesses in internal control procedures, adding that it was not able to secure sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to reasonably estimate the possibility of impairment of assets\\' evaluation rights.As a result, the KOSDAQ market is in turmoil ahead of the monthly exit of the monthly settlement corporation.According to the Japan-Korea Exchange, KOSDAQ-listed companies among monthly settlement corporations were delisted. Until now, KOSDAQ companies that have not submitted audit reports are dogs.

Half of the companies that were sanctioned tried to improve their image by changing their company names.According to the Korea Exchange and the securities industry, the total number of companies that have been disciplined for the designation of unfaithful disclosure corporations related to performance forecasting disclosures that began last year is total opening. Half of these companies were either removed from the market or on the verge of being removed, the survey showed. Individual companies have been decided to delist, and individual companies have been designated as management items due to capital erosion that has not been submitted in semi-annual reports.The company that has been delisted is Seraon Holdings Phantom Entertainment Group\\'s Solidarity Electron. Seraon Holdings and Phantom Entertainment Group were designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations last year due to inflated earnings forecasts. Seraon Holdings was expelled from the market for its consecutive capital erosion rates, and Phantom Entertainment Group and Single Electron were delisted less than a year after being sanctioned due to the rejection of audit opinions.Over-the-top performance boogers These companies\\' performance boogers were actually deceiving investors. Seraon Holdings said it is expected to achieve sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won per month. In the same year, the company lowered its forecast to 100 million won in sales and 100 million won in operating profit. However, actual sales were only KRW 100 million, which was less than the revised value, and operating losses reached KRW 100 million, let alone turning into a surplus.Danseong Electron expected its operating profit to double at the beginning of the year compared to the previous year. Since then, it has been revised to KRW 100 million in operating losses, but the actual loss has been KRW 100 million, almost double the revised value.Dichocolit ENTF and SVH, which are management items, also have a history of performance puffing. They were designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations for their annual performance. Dichocolit has been newly designated as a management item due to the failure to submit a report in the first half of the last year. SVH, which was designated as a management item due to capital erosion last month, was limited to audit opinions in the first half of the last year, adding reasons for designating a management item.In particular, SVH presented another rosy outlook this year after being sanctioned for its performance forecast last year, but failed to keep it this time. The company announced last month that it is expected to achieve sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won this year. However, sales in the first half of this year were only .100 million won, and operating losses were .100 million won, making the deficit bigger than last year.Half of the companies changed their names among the companies that attempted to improve their image by changing their signboards. WorkWonders, who was disciplined for years, changed its name to Clipping by Dicho Collet & T-Pro Phantom Entertainment Group. LIM Edu and Berry & More, which were designated as public corporations in the city last year, changed their signboards to SVH and Maxbro, respectively. Dog companies, including SVH, have changed their mission more than once.Although it is a change of name to enhance corporate image, the stock market is looking at it in a negative light, saying it intends to dilute the bad image of the past. An official from the securities industry said, \"Many companies want to hide their past insolvency through mutual changes when their corporate image has deteriorated due to frequent disciplinary action.\"Some companies have been disciplined for their puffed rice performance, but their business conditions have improved since then. Lumi Micro is a representative example. Lumi Micro was designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation this year due to its performance last year, but sales in the first half increased compared to the same period last year and operating losses also decreased by nearly half. Uni-Nancy, which was disciplined in the same year, also turned its operating profit into a surplus in the first half.Byun Kwang-deok, head of the Korea Exchange\\'s disclosure system team, said, \"Not all companies are insolvent just because they were disciplined for their performance forecasts, but they need to be careful about such things as checking their disclosures.\" Kim Yu-na\\'s announcement of breaking up with Orser on her mini homepage to find a way to stabilize housing prices Stop lying about her successful investment in Orser Today\\'s recommended week.

In some places, sales or orders for the half-year are only the annual target, while others have turned to deficits although they have put forward rosy forecasts. The accounts of investors who were deceived by the prospect of the puffed rice business have been halved. With this amount, it is worth saying that it is deceit beyond the level of exaggeration.According to the Japanese securities industry, SBH, an essay content company, announced last year that it would achieve monthly sales of 100 million won and operating profit of 100 million won. However, sales in the first half of this year were only expected to reach 100 million won. In addition, it recorded operating loss of KRW 100 million instead of operating profit, widening the deficit from the same period last year.At that time, the company said it would expand the business of online comprehensive classes, increase franchise academies, supply English textbooks, and expand kindergartens. In the first half of the year, sales of the academy business and product sales were KRW.Dong-A Estech also submitted a poor report card. The company said it expects operating profit of 100 million won for this month, but operating profit of the first half was only 100 million won. In order to achieve the original goal, double profits in the first half of the year must be raised. It said it will revise its earnings forecast for the second half of the year only after announcing its quarterly earnings.An official from Dong-A S-Tech said, \"The sales in the first half of the year accounted for an average level of annual sales,\" adding, \"We failed to meet our operating profit target due to soaring raw material prices.\"Gyeryong Construction also announced earlier this year that the estimated amount of new orders was about KRW billion, but it achieved only KRW .100 million won by the first half of this year. In addition, Cho Kwang presented his annual sales target of 100 million won each, but his semi-annual performance was only 100 million won.In some cases, the outlook for new businesses was inflated. Chemical said it will enter the eco-friendly agricultural product distribution business and generate sales of 100 million won this year. The first half of the year was less than 100 million won. Online distribution proceeded as scheduled, but the company explained that the performance of the offline sector, such as the distribution of group meals and department stores, was significant.Investors who believe in puffed rice disclosures are worried. This is because the stock prices of these companies have fallen to a serious extent. SVH, which was the original unit at the end of last year, fell into the circle. Gyeryong Construction fell from 10,000 won to 10,000 won, while Dong-A Estech fell from won to won.The KOSDAQ Market Headquarters of the Korea Exchange selects companies with excessive error rates of forecasts and actual management performance to prevent investor damage caused by performance puffing and designates them as unfaithful disclosure corporations. Last month, Lumi Micro Ubitron Uniensis and others were designated as unfaithful disclosure corporations.However, the level of disciplinary action is light and ineffective. SVH was also designated as an unfaithful disclosure corporation last year due to the prospect of puffed rice.A company official said, \"Companies that need to raise their stock prices often have positive future plans as much as possible,\" adding, \"If there is a government policy that is expected, they may come up with hasty forecasts even before implementation.\"Byun Kwang-deok, head of the Korea Exchange, said, \"We are strengthening monitoring to reduce investor damage from the inflated earnings outlook,\" adding, \"Investors also need to carefully check whether the outlook leads to actual performance.\" A spectacular first half festival...The financial sector is depressed in the first half of the year.

       " 'The number of places where the company\\'s largest shareholder and CEO have changed significantly after the quarterly earnings season is increasing rapidly.According to the electronic disclosure system of the Japan Financial Supervisory Service, the place where the largest shareholder changed after the closing of the performance season was where the CEO changed. Among them, the CEO and the largest shareholder have changed at the same time.Some in the stock market point out that companies that have changed their largest shareholders and CEO after the performance season should be somewhat cautious. This is because each company is revealing the reason why it has nothing to do with its performance on the surface, but it cannot be ignored.In fact, these companies\\' quarterly performance is extremely poor. Most companies recorded operating losses and current losses, while sales amounted to only a few billion won. The sales of Woori Cigarettes, which changed its largest shareholder and CEO at the same time, recorded operating losses of about KRW 100 million and net losses for the current period, while Eugene Data Rutiz, whose largest shareholder changed, and Smex, which changed its CEO, all recorded operating losses and net losses.G&E, who also changed its CEO, was limited in its audit opinion. In addition, stock market experts say that caution is required as some companies that have recently changed their company\\'s sign have already been damaged a lot.PolyVision, which also changed its largest shareholder\\'s director at the same time, saw its stock price well over 10,000 won before the financial crisis, but its stock price is currently below the original level as it has not recovered even after the financial crisis.SVH Verified English Company is showing a stock price trend that falls short of its face value. Among them, some companies cut back to bleach their stock prices, which have been lowered due to corporate insolvency, but their stock prices have returned to face value amid continued deterioration in performance.Of course, there are places that are not. Technology, which reported that its representative has changed, also posted record quarterly performance.A stock market expert said, \"Changing the largest shareholder and its representative is an important matter that can lead to very significant changes in companies, so we should pay more attention to them, especially if they are not performing well.\" According to an analysis of the value of investment in Godeok Complex, the company won the battle against Genesis Coupe Porsche, which is about $10,000 a year, and won the lottery for North Korea\\'s rice heavy equipment cement support.']"
